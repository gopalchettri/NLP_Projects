    "#### [Q] How to determine if a review is positive or negative?\n",
    "[Ans] We could use the Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 could be cosnidered a positive review. A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review."

      "I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.\n",

      "I have a whole box of peanut butter dog cookies and she wont touch them. She loves these and begs for them so it was a good buy. She is a little chihuhua and they are not too big for her mouth. About 20 per box.\n",

      "When my daughter was an infant, she was allergic to something in my breastmilk and was put on Neocate which worked wonders for her allergic colitis.  For my son, we were therefore very careful when it came time to picking out a formula to supplement breastmilk.  His stomach does react when I have accidentally had more dairy than I can tolerate so my pediatrician recommended a lactose free formula, especially given our Asian background.  I wanted something organic, not soy, lactose free, and with as clean of a label as possible and this formula fulfills all of those criteria.  My son didn't like it at first, but now he switches easily between breastmillk and formula.  He has not been gassy nor spit up on it.  I really wish Amazon stocked it.\n",

      "After reading all the great reviews, I optimistically ordered some of this tea. I've had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of remedies with little success.  Unfortunately, this really didn't do anything for me.  The taste is OK (bearable), but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion.  (So far the only things I've found that have helped me somewhat are the Vicks personal warm mist humidifier and Neti Xlear)\n",

      "The 4 pounds of sliced meat itself are contained in a single cardboard box; no vacuum seal or even plastic wrap.  That box is placed in another box that is lined with styrofoam sides, styrofoam peanuts, and three frozen \"ice\" paks.  It was shipped FedEx 2 Day (that's what the label says), not Overnight or next business day, which begs the question, what exactly did the $52 in shipping charges for 4 lbs of meat and minimal packing materials actually go towards?  I think I know, and it wasn't shipping.<br /><br />Years ago \"Grecian Delight\" (the brand on the box) was sold in a local supermarket chain in Gyro Kit boxes - each contained a pack of sliced gyro meat, one pita, and a small container of tzatziki sauce.  I loved them, but I haven't seen the kits in decades and was happy to find a way to once again stock the freezer with gyros-in-waiting.<br /><br />The gyro meat itself, which I have ordered before, tastes just like ... gyro meat!  As I said, I love gyros, but there's no place nearby where I can drop in and enjoy one.  So I have ordered the product in the past, but in this case, I've ordered for the last time.<br /><br />I've gotten the individual 1 lb vacuum packets before 3 at a time and they've arrived frozen or nearly frozen. Not so this box.  The meat was not only thawed, it was only slightly cool. I'm afraid I'm going to be throwing it out.  Too risky.  For $52 shipping charges, it should have arrived in perfect condition. Overnight. I won't make this mistake again.  I can't afford to.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "It is a great product. It is very nutritional and our dogs absolutely love them. My only issue is that it is outrageously expensive. It is about four times as expensive as coffee per pound, and coffee is already expensive. Liver is a very cheap meat so why $25 per pound. Our problem is our dogs will do anything to get one of these treats, so were stuck.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Be very careful to check out the the oz size, the picture is deceiving. I was under the impression that this is the same 22 ounces but it was actually the 13.20z size. When I tried to return it, Amazon didn't give me that option. Why would anyone in their right minds pay $16.11 for case of 13 oz can of dog food when you can get the same case at the grocery (Publix) store for $10.79 and even less at Walmart. Total rip-off!!!!!\n",
