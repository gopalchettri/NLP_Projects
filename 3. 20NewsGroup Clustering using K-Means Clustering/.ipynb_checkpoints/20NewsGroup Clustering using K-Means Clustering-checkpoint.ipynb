I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus\\n> confused \"kleros\", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of\\n> land discussed.  In actuality it is \"chorion\", which is the last word Acts\\n> 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I\\n> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.\\n\\nI abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from\\nothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do\\nnot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in\\nthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \"chorion.\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \\nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\\ndiscussing the \"Potter\\'s Field.\"\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n    Precise knowledge is the only true knowledge, and he who does not teach\\n    exactly, does not teach at all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHenry Ward Beecher\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmerican Clergyman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas recorded by George Seldes\\n', \"From: babb@sciences.sdsu.edu (J.

Is this reasonable?\\n\\nBasically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth. Also, I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of \\nthe thing.

The FBI and\\nthe BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their\\nstupidity and lies.    \\n\\nNow before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as \\na bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.\\n\\nThey told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, \\nwhoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into\\ntown on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and \\nwondered why they didn\\'t pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.\\nFirst, they didn\\'t see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they\\ndidn\\'t care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got\\nit.\\n\\nAfter the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were\\ncoming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.\\nWell, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.\\n\\nDid they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to\\nthem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised\\nKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 \\n The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.\\nHis grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh\\'s Real name)  she didn\\'t raise\\nDavid Koresh.\"\\n\\nSomeone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a\\nlogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.\\n\\nHere\\'s another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that\\nthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must\\nbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?\\n\\nI knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how\\nmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the \"Justification\" part\\npart of the plan.  That\\'s when I knew it would come soon.\\n\\nBut, back to the plan.  It is considered \"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\" to\\nexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what\\'s acceptable.\\n\\nThey knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not\\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \\ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\\n\\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training\\nis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were\\nsubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical \\nagent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.\\n\\nI have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of\\nthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.\\n\\nWe waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these\\npeople 51 days.  \\n\\nI stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole\\nthing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks\\nchanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:\\n\\n\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the\\noperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal\\nshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\"\\n\\nIt took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.\\n\\nOne more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic\\nweapons on the premises. \\n                                                      \\n        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!\\n\\nTHEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE.

Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human\\nspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?\\n\\n2) Science cannot explain origins.\\n\\nThis is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends\\non what origins we are talking about.\\n\\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\\n\\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \"higher\\ntruth\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \"higher\" or \\n\"lower\"; they are simply true.\\n\\nMore to the point, restricting one\\'s discussion of origins to science\\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\\nscope of discussion.\\n\\n4) This is a false premise.\\n\\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\\n\\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\\n\\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say\\nthat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.\\nHowever one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,\\nperhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.\\n\\n6) It is truly a wonder observing God\\'s creation.\\n\\nLet us not quibble; count this one as true.\\n\\n7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent\\nreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]\\n\\nStill another false statement.  However one can make it come out true\\nwith the following contextual modification:\\n\\n\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent\\nof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of\\nwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\"\\n\\n-----\\n\\nIt is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch\\non truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do\\nhim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his\\npersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that\\nhe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\\n-- \\nRichard Harter: SMDS Inc.

In addition, the four gospel accounts\\n>        are very much in harmony.  \\n\\nBill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the\\nJosephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean\\nan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the\\nchips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be\\ndefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are\\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\\n\\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \\nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \\nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\\n\\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\\nthe Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\\nhere.  What\\'s more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\"\\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\"  Far more independent\\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\\nbelief is based on faith.  That\\'s OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\\nfaith off as fact.\\n\\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn\\'t a perfect canon be perfect? \\nShouldn\\'t there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \\nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \\nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \\nan evolutionary ancestry).\\n\\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. \\nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \\nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\\nto \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\\nsaying \"I am right because I say so.\"  \\n\\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \\nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\\n\"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\\nresurrected, 4) Jesus\\' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe\\n\"inerrant\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the\\nfirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant\\nbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to \\ncontain the first four.  \\n\\nSmoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!\\n\\nIts faith, Bill.  You don\\'t have any more or better truths than anyone else. \\nWhatever works for you.

Supposedly, the government rethought this\\nsoon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of\\ntheir signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is\\nquickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which\\ntravels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore,\\nthe published data showed that when noise drowned out regular\\nreception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.\\n\\nIF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the\\nman who INVENTED wireless: Tesla.

The fact is, there are *two* references to\\nJesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least\\nbeen altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that\\nJosephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage\\nsays the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the\\nJews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho\\nfor Jesus and may be authentic.\\n   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference\\nto Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which\\nlack the references.\\n\\nIt is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but\\nI don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in\\nthe scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes\\nthis position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view\\nthat Jesus never existed.

I played\\nElvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made\\na very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is\\nroughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time\\nfighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,\\nespecially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to\\nstay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This \\nis not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is\\nquite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found\\nthat is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting\\nstrategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is \\nno fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain\\nmoderately challanging puzzles.\\n\\nThe really interesting thing about this game is that it is really \\nbroken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits\\nyou must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported\\nwith no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps\\nyou inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must \\nescape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit\\ntraps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines\\nand pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant\\nzombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue\\nsome humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill\\nthe very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is\\nperhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into\\nJack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper\\nvictim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must\\navoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and \\nmeet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit\\npus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to \\nstop the almost indestructible zombies.  \\n\\nOver all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a \\ncreepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though\\ngameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.\\nI heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.   \\n\\n*********************************************************\\n\\n- All prices include shipping.\\n- All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.\\n- US buyers only please.\\n- All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,\\n  priority USPS.\\n- All games include all original materials including box, manual,\\n  disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.\\n\\nThe first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to\\nget the game.

If you don\\'t believe the history books,\\nlook up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not\\nhave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of\\ndocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the \"knight of the\\nlong knives\" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping\\ntogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA\\'s\\nhomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I\\'ve \\nread make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. \\n\\n>(Irving, a\\n>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance\\n>minister, was homosexual.

Don\\'t you think they \\nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?\\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \\nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. \\n\\n>I challenge anyone to document this claim.\\n\\nIf you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),\\nthen the burden of proof is on you.

To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so\\nthat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis\\nmight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\\n\\nI don\\'t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser\\'s friends\\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \\nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\\'s homosexuality.\\n\\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \\npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \\nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \\nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \\nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \"evils\" of homosexuality.\\nWhy should this suprise anyone?

Thus you achieve your\\naim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note\\nthat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since\\nyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left\\nonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.\\n\\nA sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus\\na mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use\\nthe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the\\nfour enable lines.\\n\\nOf course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the\\nfour final stage decoders.\\n\\nPlease give me the credit when you submit your homework.\\n\\nJohnH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\\\/           School of MPCE\\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\\n\\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\", 'From: sandy47@cats.ucsc.edu ()\\nSubject: Laserdisks Forsale - $20\\nOrganization: University of California; Santa Cruz\\nLines: 97\\nDistribution: usa\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: si.ucsc.edu\\n\\n\\nThe following laserdisks are in used but \"like-new\" condition:\\n\\n\\nCategory\\tTitle\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPrice\\n=========================================================================\\n\\nHorror\\t\\tRabid Grannies\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t20.00\\n\\t\\t\"A blood-spattered tale of two little old\\n\\t\\tladies who open a surprise package from Hell.\"\\n\\t\\tCLV Side 2 CAV  88 min.\\n\\nHorror\\t\\tForbidden World\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t20.00\\n\\t\\t\"Subject 20 is half-human, and one of the \\n\\t\\tresearchers is the father.\"  Roger Corman, Prod.\\n\\t\\tCLV 77 min.\\n\\nHorror\\t\\tHorror Planet\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t20.00\\n\\t\\t\"An alien creature has been waiting for a\\n\\t\\tmillion years to breed, and its time has come.\"\\n\\t\\tCLV 93 min.\\n\\nHorror\\t\\tWitchTrap\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t20.00\\n\\t\\t\"...and in the upstairs shower, we have the \\n\\t\\tsexy Ms. Ginger Kowowski and this is where all \\n\\t\\tthe chillingly frightful fun comes to a head.\"\\n\\t\\tCLV 92 min.\\n\\nMurder \\t\\tBikini Island\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t20.00\\n\\t\\t\"Swimwear Illustrated needs a cover girl and \\n\\t\\tthe competition is fierce, very fierce.\\n\\t\\tCLV 85 min.\\n\\nComedy\\t\\tHysterical\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t20.00\\n\\t\\t\"It\\'s a blend of timeless farce, contemporary\\n\\t\\tsatire, nonsensical sight gags and dead people\\n\\t\\tsinging and dancing.\"  Hudson Brothers\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tCLV 90 min.\\n\\nComedy\\t\\tHollywood Hot Tubs 2\\t\\t\\t\\t20.00\\n\\t\\t\"Valley Girl, Crystal, is back in another\\n\\t\\tsuperheated frolic through those \"Hollywood\\n\\t\\tHot Tubs\".\"  CLV 100 min.\\n\\nComedy\\t\\tBeverly Hills Brats\\t\\t\\t\\t20.00\\n\\t\\t\"Scooter\\'s in trouble now, his kidnappers \\n\\t\\tdon\\'t take credit cards.\"  Martin Sheen\\n\\t\\tCLV  90 min.\\n\\nComedy\\t\\tTransylvania 6-5000\\t\\t\\t\\t20.00\\n\\t\\t\"The good citizens of Transylvania invite you\\n\\t\\tto this, the most frighteningly funny event of\\n\\t\\tthe year.\"  Ed Begley Jr., Jeff Goldblum\\n\\t\\tCLV 94 min.\\n\\nComedy\\t\\tMeet the Hollowheads\\t\\t\\t\\t20.00\\n\\t\\t\"Makes the \"Married...With Children\" gang look\\n\\t\\tsane!

Your 2F2 cap\\nwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in\\napplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their\\nperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.\\nThe other point is that big electro\\'s are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,\\nso calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering\\nthe cold).\\n\\nYou should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,\\nthat \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every\\n1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would\\nneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the\\nfiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz\\noscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator\\nremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.\\n\\nI would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the\\nsolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.\\n\\nCaveat - I\\'m not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can\\'t\\nguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable\\nconditions.\\n\\nJohnH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\\\/           School of MPCE\\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\\n\\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n', \"From: hinds@cmgm.stanford.edu (Alexander Hinds)\\nSubject: Sega Genesis + games for sale\\nKeywords: sega, genesis, games\\nOrganization: Stanford University, California, USA\\nLines: 11\\n\\nI have a Sega Genesis (barely used) that IUd like to sell with the following games:\\n\\nSonic the Hedgehog (I)\\nRevenge of Shinobi\\nThunderforce III\\n\\nI'm asking $160 OBO.

What was the scope\\'s actual sampling\\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\\n\\nIs the HP scope you\\'re using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\\n\\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\\nof the scope.

In fact, it is the combination of the two\\nstatements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to\\ncharacterize that as \"ignoring\" the instruction to spread the\\nword is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.\"\\n\\nOf course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of \"instruction\\nto spread the word.\"\\n\\nAll these quotes btw are from:\\n\\nMessage-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>\\n\\n>in which, at the end, he claims I did not answer a question\\n>which I answered, and which he deleted (to get the chronology\\n>right, he deleted the answer and then said I didn\\'t answer).\\n\\nAnd I claim it correctly, because my question went:\\n\\n\"Do you, too, measure\\nthe goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not\\na whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?\"\\n\\nand the closest Dean came to an answer was:\\n\\n\"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You\\'re just so stupid, pretentious, dull,\\nand generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that\\nthe sport is all there is.\"\\n\\nOf course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts\\nin GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,\\nyet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:\\n\\n\"So I now restore the answer to your question\\nthat you deleted.  If you\\'re still unable to figure it out, ask\\na nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really\\ndoesn\\'t take much sophistication to understand.\"\\n\\nOn top of which, I doubt that the \"answer\" is at all representative\\nof Dean\\'s true frame of mind.

I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one\\'s sins.\\nThat I made public announcements of the \"sins\" of others\\n--\"sins\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in\\nthe posts of others-- is a different matter.\\n\\nMany of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that\\nthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so\\nI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,\\nYOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.\\n\\nDean again:\\n\\n\"You made an ass of yourself\\nby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was\\nsomehow an attempt to \"paint Jews as plaster saints,\" thereby\\nrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as well\\nas showing your dislike for people saying positive things\\nabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by\\nrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then\\nclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\"\\n\\nActually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew\\nwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite\\naccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing\\nJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as\\nimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.\\n\\nI went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of\\nthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about \"plaster saints\", \\nsuggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.\\n\\nIn an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly\\ndistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as\\nthe basis of one insult after another.\\n\\nPeter Nyikos\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', \"From: vanderby@mprgate.mpr.ca (David Vanderbyl)\\nSubject: Re: Power, signal surges in home...\\nNntp-Posting-Host: chip\\nReply-To: vanderby@mprgate.mpr.ca (David Vanderbyl)\\nOrganization: MPR Teltech Ltd.\\nLines: 15\\n\\nkludge@grissom.larc.nasa.gov (Scott Dorsey) writes:\\n\\n>My car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it's\\n>astonishingly sensitive to RFI.

Gay people are and will\\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans that\\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\\nFortunately African-Americans had \"whites\" who supported their \\'cause\\' and\\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\\n\\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord\\'s great commandment to Love,\\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\\nin the commandment of Love (though I\\'m hard-pressed to find many who actually\\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\\ntreated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such.  I guess I\\'ve\\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\\n\\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don\\'t know of one\\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\\n\\nI\\'m apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\\noppressive legisation against gays.\\n\\nPerhaps you don\\'t get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn\\'t get it in the\\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God\\'s will be done as they massacred thousands\\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\\n\\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn\\'t change\\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\\n\"conditional\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we\\'ll love you. This is\\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \"unconditional\"\\nlove, one that calls people \"just as they are.\"  Sure there are things that\\nwill \\'naturally\\' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other\\npeople\\'s expectations.\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many\\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\\n\\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\\nsomething very personal like \\'sexuality\\' (a taboo subject even today), but I\\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\\non thier bedrooms.  It\\'s funny that most straight people have successfully\\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\\nGay people are not criminals.\\n\\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it\\'s pastors arrested for self-\\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\\nrecently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the\\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\\n\\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\\nColorado has created an organization who\\'s posters are appearing all over\\nColorado called \"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\\nis \"Working for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\\n\\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\\nembracing.\\n\\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\\ntowards those we feel don\\'t \\'measure up\\', and constant beratement from\\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\\nexcluding people.\\n\\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\"\\npeople.

But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some \\nreferences.  See Robin Lane Fox\\'s _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where \\nLane Fox writes, \"... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus\\' \\ncareer] is agreed to be a Christian addition.\"\\n\\nIn my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21\\nApril 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine \\nPagel\\'s _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  \"A comment *attributed* to\\nJosephus reports ... [emphasis mine]\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention\\nthe two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.\\n\\nSo far as I can deduce, today\\'s consensus is built on at least three things: \\n1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the\\nlong passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. \\nI don\\'t know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are\\norginally developed (does anyone?).\\n\\nBiblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The\\nformer, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and\\nideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I \\ndidn\\'t elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to\\nincorporate theology).\\n\\nCan\\'t say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before \\nGutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one \\nhand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,\\nbecause anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is \\ncertainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have \\nthe two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic \\nms.

Christian people have caused\\n\"objective morality\" to look very \"relative.\"  After all, that was the\\npoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out\\nChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own\\nprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this\\napparent inconsistency from at least one Christian\\'s viewpoint:\\n\\nIf God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then\\nHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick\\nphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \"objective\" morality for us.\\nThat is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or\\ndetrimental to) the creature He created. \\n\\n\\tGalatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in\\n\\tChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared\\n\\tbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.\\n\\nHowever, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees\\nof the Bible,) God\\'s morality cannot be completely codified in a list\\nof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a\\nperson\\'s life creates a new situation to which morality must be\\napplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God\\'s\\n\"objective\" morality for us. \\n\\nThroughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of\\nrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have\\nboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the\\nprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.\\nVolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the\\napplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren\\'t comfortable with\\nthe \"subjectivity\" of principles. \\n\\n\\tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference\\n\\tbetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in\\n\\tverses 21-22:  \"You have heard that the ancients were told,\\n\\t\\'You shall not commit murder\\'...and \\'Whoever commits murder shall\\n\\tbe liable to the court.\\'  But I say to you that everyone who is\\n\\tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\"\\n\\nThe \"objective morality\" of God gets blurred by our inept\\ninterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors\\nwhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY\\nwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to\\nseeking God\\'s will instead of trying to prove we already had it all\\nfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God\\'s\\n\"objective morality\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he\\nwas/is (and that\\'s the fundamental question,) then HE IS \"objective\\nmorality.\" \\n\\nJohn Nunnally\\n', \"From: rtsbangi@msuvx1.memst.edu\\nSubject: ********cd for sale********\\nDistribution: world\\nOrganization: Memphis State University\\nLines: 11\\n\\ncd's for sale:\\n\\n1. jon bon jovi - new jersey      $8.00\\n2. boomerang    - soundtrack      $8.00\\n3. the police   - every breath you take  $8.00\\n\\n */ $1.00 s/h \\n\\ne_mail rtsbangi@memstvx1.memst.edu\\n\\n\\n\", 'From: peter.m@insane.apana.org.au (Peter Tryndoch)\\nSubject: Telephone On Hook/Off Hok\\nLines: 17\\n\\nAllMichael CovingtonTelephone on hook/off hok\\n\\nMC>From: mcovingt@aisun3.ai.uga.edu (Michael Covington)\\nMC>Organization: AI Programs, University of Georgia, Athens\\nMC>Aye, there\\'s the rub -- if you draw enough current to light an LED, th\\nMC>equipment at the phone company will think you\\'ve gone off hook.\\nMC>In the on-hook state you\\'re not supposed to draw current.  \\n\\nOk lets have some calculation here: Going by Australian standards, which I \\npresume might be similar to other countries ( If not, lets have some \\ninput) a phone uses 600ohm to loop a 48V line = 80mA.

(Poor you!)\\n\\nThe Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you \\nsouldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of \\ncopying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to \\nthe protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the \\nprotection.\\n\\nOne thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape \\nfor viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an \\nextra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR \\nfirst, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I \\ndon't know if they would react or not.

Is this true?\\n\\nI own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no\\n  amp which can touch it at the price range.\\nThe build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other \\n  amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid\\n  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.\\nIf you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components \\n  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect\\n  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each\\n  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are\\n  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.\\n\\nI was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east\\n  or where-ever.

It was the religion of the great Persian\\nEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ\\nwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three\\nZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,\\nJews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the\\nZoroastrian prophet.\\n\\n   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are \\na miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a\\npeople is very much on their minds.\\n\\n   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance\\nof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed\\nby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause\\ntheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they\\nactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children\\nbecome totally assimilated, they say, it\\'s their children - rather than\\nthe world at large - who will be the losers.\\n\\n   \"It\\'s important to have an identity,\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,\\na leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \"It\\'s important\\nfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.\\nYou don\\'t have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.\\nYou can fall back on your own identity.\"\\n\\n   For Zoroastrians, there\\'s much to be proud of.\\n\\n   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which\\nanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was\\nonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which\\ntranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.\\n\\n_Good vs. evil_\\n\\n   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with\\nthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for\\ngood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences\\nsuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,\\nkindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of\\nmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.\\n\\n   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to\\nfollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,\\nJoseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,\\ntraced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a\\nstained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of\\nMount Hamilton, is \"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\"\\n\\n   So it\\'s not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,\\nwhere a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape\\npersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;\\nthe overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.\\n\\n   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India\\nand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from\\nIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state\\nwhere others had no rights.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \"good\\ndeeds\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,\\nthe recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because\\nManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up\\ndowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple\\'s\\ndedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the\\nZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\\n\\n   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an\\nIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples\\nin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount\\nHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,\\nand Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on\\nthis continent.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the\\nproperty already had a large house that they have converted to a\\ncommunity center.\\n\\n   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet \\nZoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted \\nceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.\\n\\n   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-\\nin area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are \\nsometimes called \"fire worshippers,\" they actually consider fire just \\na symbol of God.  \"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the \\ncross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\" Bhujwala said.\\n\\n   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all\\nIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of\\nthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With\\nZoroaster\\'s birthday just six days later, the combination of religious\\nand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the\\nUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.\\n\\n  For this year\\'s celebration of the prophet\\'s birthday, about 500 people\\ncame to worship and revel.\\n\\n   \"The good things in life are not forbidden,\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,\\na leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed\\nproved him right.\\n\\n   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood\\naround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted\\nthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking\\nsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit\\nand nuts.\\n\\n   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \"People eat the\\nfruit,\" Tarapore said.  \"It\\'s a way to participate in the ceremony.\"\\n\\n_Santa Claus, sort of_\\n\\n   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white\\nhair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green\\nsymbolic of spring) and red.\\n\\n   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and\\nplayed a tambourine.\\n\\n   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \"This is all new for us, too,\"\\none told a visitor who asked what was going on.\\n\\n   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with\\nthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have\\nno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their\\ncenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu\\nking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his\\npeople\\'s religion.\\n\\n   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the\\nSan Jose temple whenever he can.\\n\\n   \"When I first heard about this religion,\" he said, \"I thought, my God,\\nthis is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.\\n\\n   \"People who don\\'t have a tradition, something to lean on, what\\'s the\\ndifference with the lower animals?\"\\n\\n------------------------------------------------ end of article ---- \\n', 'From: Gregory.Park@dartmouth.edu (Gregory Park)\\nSubject: ROLAND JUNO-60 SYNTHESIZER*UNIDEN RADAR DETECTOR 4 SALE\\nX-Posted-From: InterNews 1.0b15@dartmouth.edu\\nOrganization: Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH\\nLines: 10\\n\\nROLAND JUNO 60- SYNTHESIZER.

If\\nyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will\\nnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. \\nThe fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle\\n(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of\\nthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!\\n\\nIt used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for\\nan officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many\\nlaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. \\nRight, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF\\nfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \"no way!\" \\nBut, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police\\nare writing citations right and left for people using radar\\ndetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had\\nfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,\\nand he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was\\nthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.\\n\\nNow, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or\\nnear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me\\nfrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my\\nspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar\\ndetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which\\nis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to\\nobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.\\n\\nFor my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only\\nworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave\\nenlightment may be necessary.\\n\\nSo, the questions are -\\n  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?\\n  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by\\n  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector\\n  antenna?\\n  Are any brands \"quieter\" than others?\\n\\n==============================================================================\\nRandy T.

These\\n> are some that I\\'ve been able to identify.  Please add/comment on\\n> them.\\n> \\n> \\n> Motif #1 -- THE MALE-CINDERELLA.  \\n> \\n> In so many of the stories there is expressed a feeling of\\n> alienation and worthlessness on the part of the writer or\\n> otherwise protagonist of the story with regard to the object (the\\n> other person) of his/her desire. Often a story involves a\\n> protagonist who (on the surface) is quite average (but underneath\\n> usually has an enormous dick), who desires to in some way to gain\\n> access (in a definitely sexual way) to the other person who\\n> he/she confesses is far more desireable than he/she is and who\\n> indeed seems \"to walk between the rain-drops.\"   \\n\\nHmmm...do I detect just a wee bit of condescence here?\\n                                                      \\n> \\n> Motif #2 -- A CELEBRATION OF (INDEED PREOCCUPATION WITH) BEAUTY.\\n                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot very objective. \\n\\n> The vast majority of pornographic literature deals with beauty,\\n> be it innocence (somehow about to be lost), grace, or simply\\n> physical beauty.  And generally, most people Christian or non\\n> will say that beauty is good. \\n\\nOne could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better, or \"more\\ngood\" than non-beautiful people.  I would hope that people relize that this is\\nnot necessarily true.\\n                     \\n> \\n> Motif #3 -- ONE\\'S DICK IS ONE\\'S INSTRUMENT OF REDEMPTION.  \\n                    ^^^^\\n      Might I suggest the word \"penis\"? It seems more in line with the tone of\\nyour post. \\n          \\n>      Blessed are those who are well-hung, for they shall get\\n>      laid. -- from what would thus be a revised Matthew 5 :-).\\n> \\n\\nBravo!  I respect you and your sense of humor, sir. \\n\\n> \\n> Motif #4 -- SEX AS AN EXPRESSION OF SINCERE GIVING.  \\n>                                                  \\n> There is, often enough, a clear desire on the part of the\\n> protagonist, to give (definitely sexual) pleasure to the object\\n> (person) of his/her desires.\\n                                                 \\nYes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However,\\nthey are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf\\nSternberg, for example.\\n\\n> \\n> Motif #5 -- ALT.SEX.STORIES DESCRIBES A SEX WHICH IS COMPLETELY\\n> REMOVED FROM THE REALM OF \"TRANSMITTING LIFE\"  \\n> \\n> So removed is sex from its procreative dimension on\\n> alt.sex.stories, that one begins to wonder why sex even involves\\n> ejaculation, as in the context described in pornography it serves\\n> then no real purpose.  \\n\\nIt serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies: it affirms the\\nvirility of the male involved, as well as assuring the reader that he (the\\ncharacter) has orgasmed.                      \\n\\n> The Whole Picture [TM] is probably very well described by the\\n> Catholic teaching on this: Of the husband and wife, in an act of\\n> total mutual self-giving in the sexual union, cooperating with\\n> God in opening themselves up for the transmission of new life\\n> (cf. Humane Vitae).  \\n\\nYour Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your\\nchurch.\\n         \\nIn addition, if sex is for procreation, then\\n\\n1)\\tWhy did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it,\\nrather than building it in as instinct?\\n2)\\tWhy did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in\\npregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?\\n \\n> In any case alt.sex.stories and the Catholic teaching will\\n> probably not see eye to eye on this for a long time.\\n \\nGranted.\\n\\n> \\n> Motif #6 -- SEX USED AS AN INSTRUMENT VIOLENCE, POWER AND\\n> HUMILIATION.  \\n>                                   \\n> Why pornography seems to tend in that direction, I really do not\\n> know.  Probably volumes could be written on the relationships\\n> between sex and power/humiliation.  But this probably gives good\\n> reason why traditionally Judeo-Christianity has been so negative\\n> with regard to sexuality -- it seems to tend to a great moral\\n> morass. \\n\\nPornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for\\nit.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real\\nlife, but will think about and read about and mull over.\\n\\nLater,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJeff                                   \\n\\n-- \\nJeffJ@yang.earlham.edu - Official generic .sig.

What is the source of this pseudo-doctrine? Who is\\n> the pseudo-teacher? Who is the Great Deceiver?\\n\\nOK, here\\'s at least one Christian\\'s answer:\\n\\nJesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes\\nsense.  Matt 5:17 \"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or\\nthe Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\"  Jesus lived\\nunder the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises\\nof the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey\\nGod\\'s purposes.\\n\\nVerse 18 says \"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass\\naway, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,\\nuntil all is accomplished.\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last \\nphrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \"accomplished\" what the \\nLaw was supposed to accomplish.  \\n\\nVerse 19:  \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\\nand so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;\\nbut whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the\\nkingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \\npeople about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\\n\\nIn general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \\nmust have received about \"doing away with the Law.\"  That was not \\nJesus\\' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it \\nshould be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his \\npeople all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your \\nheel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \"doing \\naway with the Law\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as \\nequal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious \\nleaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only \\nGod\\'s Law.\\n\\nIn the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law \\nand defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon \\non the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people \\nunderstand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which \\nhad been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.\\n\\nIn Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the \\nLaw in this way:\\n\\n[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being \\nshut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore \\nthe Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be \\njustified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no \\nlonger under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith \\nin Christ Jesus.\\n\\nI believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had \\nserved it\\'s purpose, i.e. \"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\" and\\nnow, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\"  The law has been \"fulfilled\" \\nas Christ said he would do.\\n\\nGod, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same\\npersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \"last\\nwill and testament\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. \\nIt makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are\\nre-expressed in Christianity. \\n\\nOn the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it\\'s purpose and \\nChristians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes \\nsense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to \\nrepresent the \"mysteries\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism \\nrepresenting Christ\\'s death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),\\nThe Lord\\'s supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and\\nSunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,\\nActs 20:7)\\n\\nOK, That\\'s one Christian\\'s explanation.  I don\\'t claim to have all\\nthese issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome\\nother Christians to offer other alternatives.\\n\\nPlease excuse the long posting.

An awful lot of the\\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they\\'ve got.\\n\\nPerhaps it\\'s more accurate to say that there\\'s a Western ethic against\\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn\\'t give a shit.  And that goes for the\\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by\\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\\nabortion.  Hell, if they\\'re only interested in fetuses, they could save more\\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\\n\\nAnd besides, Suzanne\\'s answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\\nethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory\\nforced abortion in Tibet, I don\\'t believe this to be the case.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n', 'From: mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca (Malcolm Lee)\\nSubject: Re: A KIND and LOVING God!!\\nOrganization: Royal Roads Military College, Victoria, B.C.\\nLines: 70\\n\\n\\nIn article <1r0hicINNjfj@owl.csrv.uidaho.edu>, lanph872@crow.csrv.uidaho.edu (Rob Lanphier) writes:\\n|> Malcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9\\n|> and Deuteronomy 22:20-25:\\n|> : These laws written for the Israelites, God\\'s chosen people whom God had\\n|> : expressly set apart from the rest of the world.

Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of\\nHeaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made\\nobsolete by Jesus.\\n\\nIf anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\\nfollowing verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\\nthe Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you\\'ll notice, He\\nalso reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived\\ninterpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their\\nheads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness\\nmust surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom\\nof Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their\\nway to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.\\nThey had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the\\nletter of the Law but never really believed in it.  \\n\\nI think you will agree with me that there are in today\\'s world, a lot of\\nmodern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\\nin it.

For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a\\ncurrent through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side\\nto the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I\\nthink a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.\\n\\nAnyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for\\npicnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a\\ncouple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an\\nefficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my\\ncar battery in about half an hour).\\n\\nUnfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic\\nspecs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the\\ntemperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably\\nits power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we\\nhave a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no\\nleakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the\\ntwo sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more\\n(although that would be a lousy way to control it).\\n\\nWhat I would like to know is:\\n\\n1: Are the above guesses correct?\\n\\n2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?\\n   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm\\n   too fast when I unplug it)\\n\\n3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?

(There\\'s a gripe in the industry\\nthat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it\\'s\\nmore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system\\nas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  \\n\\n       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\\nusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\\nway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\\nrather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal \\npollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  \\n\\n       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is \\npurified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when\\nthe water boils.

The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is considered\\nto be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.\\n\\nThe very fact that you need to build a test fixture means\\nyou're most likely going to need a socket.  It in itself\\nhas far more inductance per pin than the package you are\\ntesting, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  I\\ndon't see the big concern over the packaging because it\\nprobably isn't going to make that much difference\\n\\nIf you're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun...\\nTTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment.\\n:-(\\n\\naaron\\n\\nP.S.

I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\\nday timing cycle and so forth.\\n\\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\\noff ;-)\\n\\nThanks again everyone...\\n\\n-=-= Wes =-=-\\n\", 'From: cyberman@toz.buffalo.ny.us (Cyberman)\\nSubject: CRT driver transistors\\nLines: 28\\nX-Maildoor: WaflineMail 1.00r\\n\\nDevice........

Good and\\nevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.\\n\\nThe Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of\\nbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man\\'s\\nrebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of\\nthe Scriptures.\\n\\nMan was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words\\nof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was\\nthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the\\nEastern Orthodox Church, this is called \"theosis,\" or \"deification.\"\\n\\nOne can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,\\nand body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This\\nis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.\\n\\nThe beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it\\nwere to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,\\nits paradisiac state would also be destroyed.\\n\\nWas it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of\\ninnocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining\\nof self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His\\nmasterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?\\n\\nGod must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral\\nvalue, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There\\nis no other way to achieve union with God.\\n\\nJesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.\\nHe was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,\\nand making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,\\nnot in His essence, but in His energies.\\n\\nThe opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it\\nwith the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24.

Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain \\nknowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the\\nBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and\\nthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond\\nour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  \\nto seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a\\nperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find \\nsomething to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one\\nwill gain with that attitude is folly.\\n\\nBe careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages\\nin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even\\nthough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.\\nBe assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such\\ndeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. \\nI will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \"You will never\\nbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\"\\n\\n\\nFrom King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):\\n\\n    \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;\\n     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\"\\n\\n\\nJesus says in John 6:44 & 55:\\n\\n   \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd in John 3:16:\\n\\n   \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,\\n   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal\\n   life.\"\\n\\n\\nYou are included in \"whosoever\".  And I also pray that the Father is\\ndrawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn\\'t be posting\\nto talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the\\nmaking.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure\\nstoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became\\non of the most celebrated men in the history of God\\'s church.\\n\\nYou see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because\\nyou could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack\\nChristians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,\\nproclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.\\n\\nOr you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would \\nprobably say to you: \"Satan would surely like to have you.\"  Why so?\\nBecause Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great\\nmoments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task\\nhe did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the\\nfaith to walk on water as Jesus did.\\n\\nYou asked \"Why not believe in Zeus?\"  Zeus didn\\'t offer eternal life.\\nYou got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.\\n\\n-------------------------------\\nBrian Ceccarelli\\nbrian@gamma1.lpl.arizona.edu\\n', 'From: artc@iplmail.orl.mmc.com (Art)\\nSubject: Re: Brand new IDE/Floppy/2S/2P/1G card for sale\\nOrganization: MMC\\nLines: 34\\n\\nIn article <bitzm.124.0@columbia.dsu.edu>, bitzm@columbia.dsu.edu (MICHAEL BITZ) writes:\\n|> \\n|>                 For Sale\\n|>                 ********\\n|> \\n|>         IDE Multi I/O Card -- Brand new\\n|> \\n|>         Controls:\\n|>         * (2) IDE hard drives\\n|>         * (2) floppy drives (3.5\" or 5.25\", high\\n|>               or low density\\n|>         * (2) serial ports\\n|>         * (1) parallel port\\n|>         * (1) game port\\n|> \\n|>         All in one card, measuring 2.5\" x 6\"!!\\n|> \\n|>         This card is *brand* new (never been opened, much \\n|>         less used at all).  \\n|> \\n|>         **** $35.00 (including all shipping charges!) *****\\n|>         \\n|>         bitzm@columbia.dsu.edu\\n|> \\n|>        \\n|> \\n|> \\n|> ------------------------------------------------------------\\n|> Mike Bitz                   Internet: bitzm@columbia.dsu.edu\\n|> Research and Development              bitzm@dsuvax.dsu.edu\\n|> Dakota State University       Bitnet: s93020@sdnet.bitnet\\n|> \\n\\nA friend of mine is selling the same thing for $25.00!!!

OK ?\\nLet me try to explain what that tower is used to:\\n   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.\\n         It has an hightech \"boiler\" but the rest is still verry verry \\n         conventional. And if you\\'ve already visited any condensation-\\n         powerstation you\\'l have seen the cooling towers too.\\n         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you\\'ll find\\n         a chapter about the \"CARNOT-process\" which describes how to\\n         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason\\n         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you\\'ve an\\n         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one \\n         side and need to cool down the steam \\'till you get water\\n         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the \\n         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to\\n         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \"cold\"\\n         steam on the other side you\\'ll loose much more of the energy.\\n         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of\\n         energy that carnot will give them.\\n         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !\\n         The vapor you\\'ll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,\\n         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in\\n         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent\\n         radioactive pollution of the environment !\\n         \\n   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-\\n         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still\\n         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere\\n         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you\\'ll have lot\\'s of problems with\\n         the boiler\\'s steel. That\\'s because at this temperature the\\n         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.\\n         This is only for BWR\\'s. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures\\n         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. \\n\\n   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever\\n         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the\\n         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won\\'t be 0.75 mRem\\n         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you\\'ll still have\\n         1.5 mRem.

Apparently land-based\\n>beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS \\n>receiver (with differential option installed).\\n\\n>How does this system work?  What frequency is used for\\n>the land-based beacons?\\n\\n>Thanks in advance,\\n\\n>Charlie Thompson\\n>.\\n\\nHere\\'s a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station\\nwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in the\\nincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors\\nincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time\\ndithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational \\nequipment to \"back out\" the errors in its position (since it knows\\nwhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a \\nbroadcast which is available to any number of relatively local\\nreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using\\nthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very\\nsimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the\\nreceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference\\nunit.\\n\\nThe US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series\\nof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will\\nuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately\\n305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals\\non different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers\\ncorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system\\nwhich has stations all across the US.\\n\\nThe correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.\\nAdvertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJohn P.

As director of FREE\\nINDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering\\ndiscontented gays and lesbians \"a way out of the homosexual death-style\"\\nthrough prayer.  \"I\\'d like to give the award back,\" Caligiuri now laughs, \"I\\'m\\nno longer deserve it.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s eight year involvement with the national \"ex-gay\" movement peaked\\nwith his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well\\nas Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-\\ngay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \"There\\'s no reality\\nin it,\" he says, \"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\"\\n  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the\\norganizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again\\nChristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who\\nare just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their\\nsexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \"We offer support to people who are\\nseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\" explains Bob Davies, director of\\nExodus.  He ventures that \"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-\\nsexuality are men.\"\\n  \"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting\\ntheir time,\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \"redeemed lesbian\" who worked with\\nCaligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \"These\\norganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\"\\n  \"It\\'s possible to change your identity or your behavior,\" says sex educator\\nBrian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \"But it\\'s really impossible to\\nchange your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,\\nbut they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\"\\n  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all\\nhell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both\\ntheir romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted\\nby a man he picked up in a bar.  \"I was really drunk,\" he recalls, \"and I\\nwent home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all\\nnight, and the next morning he raped me again.\"\\n  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the\\nhome he shared with his ex-lover.  \"He had another man there with him,\"\\nCaligiuri recalls.  \"I thought at this time, \\'If this is what being gay is\\nabout, I don\\'t want to be this way anymore.\"\\n  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery\\nwith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix\\'s\\ngay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its\\nfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,\\nFree Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed\\nfor hell.\\n  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks\\nin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \"We were listed\\nunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\" Caligiuri says, \"so people\\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\\nwhere the local bars were, and we\\'d preach to them about the sins of homo-\\nsexuality.\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,\\nadding, \"They\\'ll do anything to reach these people.\"\\n  \"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\" recalls Peter\\nKelly, a counselor at Phoenix\\'s Catholic diocese AIDS program, \"like that\\nhe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on\\nRaphael\\'s syndicated talk show in 1985.  \"They were relieved,\" he recalls.\\n\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better\\nthat I should be a \\'reformed\\' gay person.\"\\n  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \"By the time I appeared on Sally\\'s\\nshow,\" \"I\\'d started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\\nfather.  I was horny all the time.\"\\n  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his\\nnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \"used to go to bookstores\\nand get blowjobs.\"  When he wasn\\'t working the bookstores, he was sleeping\\nwith other \"reformed\" homosexuals.\\n  \"I didn\\'t realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex\\nwith one another,\" Caligiuri says.  \"We\\'d go to conferences in other cities,\\nand we\\'d be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody\\nelse.\"\\n  By the time he appeared on \\'AM Philadelphia\\' television show in May 1988,\\nCaligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show\\'s\\nhost asked him if he ever \"acted on temptation,\" his answer was a lie.\\n  Caligiuri\\'s duplicity began to take it\\'s toll on him, however.  He was\\nsuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating\\nyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \"I was too sick\\nto go to church,\" he explains.  \"The more time I spent away from those people\\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\"\\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local\\nchurch and closed the ministry\\'s doors.  \"I\\'d convinced myself that there\\nis no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says.\\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\"I\\'m interest-\\ned in belief systems that aren\\'t judgemental.\"), considering romance (\"But\\nnot with a CHristian!\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.\\n\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says.  \"I want to\\neventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\\nmay have brought to our community.\"\\n\\n---end article---\\n\\nCaligiuri\\'s tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles\\nof former leaders and founders of \\'ex-gay\\' ministries who have said very similar th\\nsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have\\ncome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,\\nlike Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \"Lazarus Project\" of West\\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community\\nto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values\\nof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become\\nand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \"Love In\\nAction\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \"reformed\" or who\\nwere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed\\nin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \"sealing\" their\\nnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses\\nand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of\\nnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \"sin\"\\nthrough a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch\\nhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-\\ncent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet\\nthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow\\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also\\nmrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and\\nfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on\\nthem, they may even opt for \\'suicide\\' or surgical dampering of the brain\\nfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-\\nplace.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the\\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington\\'s\\n_\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.

A set of rules is a moral code or a\\n> law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\\n> to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\\n> personal involvement in and responsibility for one\\'s actions. ...\\n\\nThe two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are\\nso vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  Michael\\nSiemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution\\nof an argument over them turns on secular and cultural\\nassumptions that are independent of these rules.\\n \\n> ... The Great  Commandment is, more than anything else, a call\\n> to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility*\\n> in your every action. ...\\n\\nThe commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,\\nin part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if\\nhe has \"ultimate responsibility.\" Indeed, many traditions present\\nan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret\\nloving one\\'s neighbor as following various other rules, and\\nrelying on their god to make things come out right, precisely\\nbecause it would be wrong for man to assume such \"ultimate\\nresponsibility.\" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding\\ngoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. \\n\\n> ... \"Conservatives\" may twist this \"act as if you were God\" to \\n> mean \"lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them\\n> as possible if they don\\'t keep YOUR rules.\"  They are so\\n> insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\\n> lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such \\n> idiocy IS how God acts. ...\\n\\nAnd who is to say that this interpretation is \"twisted\"?  There\\nare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\\nreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\\nMichael cannot refer to \"base\" claims or base commandments to\\nshow that such readings are \"twisted,\" because this divergence in\\nunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the \"base\"\\nclaims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,\\nMichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions\\nthat these conservative Christians will reject.  \\n\\n> But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\\n> society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\\n> may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\\n> -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\\n\\nBut these base commandments are too vague to serve as  \"a\\nprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems.\" The meaning of\\nthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secular\\nand cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how\\nthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of\\nother Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,\\nor from some combination of these things.  These commandments\\nlack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for\\ncriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from\\nthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. \\n\\n> And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\\n> *different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\\n> it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\\n> (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\\n> It does not have a QU\\'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\\n> little, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\\n> the \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\\n> them with almost no support ... The one, single, thing in the gospels\\n> which Jesus specifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love\\n> one another.\"\\n\\nJesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which\\nwould seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what\\nit means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*\\nparables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are\\nstraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline\\nepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all\\ncome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,\\nthe problem is *not* a lack of raw material. \\n\\n-*----\\n> I am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\\n\\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \\nseriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\\ngospel.\\n\\n> ... Why don\\'t I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me\\n> tell you something about Christianity? ...\\n\\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us\\nsomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament\\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\\nshouldn\\'t do. \\n\\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\\nmake Michael\\'s Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\\nChristian interpretation.  \\n\\nMichael paints a picture of \"standard American atheism\" as the\\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I\\nthink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can\\nhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the\\nlukewarm we should spit out. \\n\\nRussell\\n', 'X-Mailer: TMail version 1.17R\\nFrom: \"D.

Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together\\n>for just a few bucks. Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old?\\n\\nYou can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, \"The\\nHungry Hiker\\'s Guide to Good Food,\" by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat source\\nis a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it\\'s a vertical wooden box with\\nventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air\\nto flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are\\nspaced every 6\" starting about 10\" above the bulb.\\n\\nOr, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use\\nyour oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may\\nnot have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or\\nracks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my\\noven - if yours goes down to 120 that\\'s probably even better.)  Stick a\\nwooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close\\nthe door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows\\nfor airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it\\noften, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are\\nusing cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway\\nthrough.\\n\\nIf you want more info, e-mail me since this isn\\'t really the right sub\\nfor this stuff.\\n\\ngerald.belton@ozonehole.com\\n\\n\\n * SLMR 2.1 * I still miss my boss, but my aim is improving.\\n                       \\n----\\nThe Ozone Hole BBS * A Private Bulletin Board Service * (504)891-3142\\n3 Full Service Nodes * USRobotics 16.8K bps * 10 Gigs * 100,000 Files\\nSKYDIVE New Orleans! * RIME Network Mail HUB * 500+ Usenet Newsgroups\\nPlease route all questions or inquiries to:  postmaster@ozonehole.com\\n', \"From: warsaw@athena.mit.edu (Daniel Maung)\\nSubject: CDs for $6\\nOrganization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\nLines: 29\\nDistribution: usa\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: alfredo.mit.edu\\n\\nI have the following CDs for sale for $6 each plus postage.\\nAll CDs are in perfect condition.\\n\\n\\nMichael Bolton        Time, Love & Tenderness      \\nPaula Abdul          Forever Your Girl\\nTaylor Dayne            Tell it to My Heart\\nLionel Richie       The Composer\\nElvis Presley      18 Number One Hits\\nBobby Vinton       Greatest Hits\\nSuper Hits of the 70's \\n(includes  Yellow River, Rose Garden, For the Good Times, \\nHelp Me Make it through the Night, Mr. Bojangles, Sweet Mary, \\nOne Toke Over the Line, Put Your Hand in Hand, Stay Awhile,\\nWoodstock, Silver Bird, I Ain't got time Anymore)\\n\\nNew Fashioned Love Songs  (import)\\n(includes extended remixes and dance mixes for the following:\\nI Know You Were Waiting - Aretha Franklin & George Michael,\\nWalk Like an Egyptian, Live It Up - Mental As Anything\\nIs this Love - Alison Moyet\\nI'll be Alright Without You - Journey\\nThe Rain - Oran Jones\\nIn My Dreams - Reo Speedwagon\\nShake You Down - Gregory Abbott\\nFight For Ourselves - Spandau Ballet\\nBetween Two Fires - Paul Young\\nFalling in Love - Miami sound machine\\nHeartache Away - Don Johnson  )\\n\", \"From: jks2x@holmes.acc.Virginia.EDU (Jason K.

In 1838, the governor of Missouri,\\n#>governor Boggs, issued his so-called \"Mormon extermination order.\"  The\\n#>only crime (\"illegal activity\") the Latter-day Saints had committed, was\\n#>their religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri still\\n#>allowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri.\\n#>\\n#>I guess the Mormons \"got what they deserved,\" because they refused to bow\\n#>to the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This \"disobedience\"\\n#>brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion from\\n#>their lands and settlements...\\n#\\n#It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by\\n#\"average\" people, and that at the time, almost all Americans were pretty\\n#homogeonously Christian. It was largely the mainstream Christian\\'s disgust\\n#at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.\\n\\nTrue, but that is exactly the \"problem\": the Mormon extermination order\\nwas issued not just by a Christian, it was ALLOWED under the Constitution\\nof the United States, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents\\nlike this \"order\" from occurring in the first place...  As I indicated in\\nan earlier posting, your \"irrational hatred\" is clearly evidenced by\\nindividuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs\\' Lieutenant;\\nhe would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day\\noccurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation,\\nlies, denying Mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc.\\n\\nIn intent and purpose, what really has changed?\\n\\n#The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings\\n#and beliefs are justified through religion.  I don\\'t think most of them\\n#are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and\\n#perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification\\n#which discourages critical thought.\\n\\nTrue, as evidenced by numerous examples, as I am sure you\\'re aware.\\n\\n#>In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and\\n#>I don\\'t even discuss how Uthan\\'s were suckered into allowing part of their\\n#>lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from\\n#>being trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  I\\n#>may be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the\\n#>case. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church\\n#>leader) strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-\"Peace Keeper\"\\n#>missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another \"inspired\" decision from\\n#secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough\\n#for the feds to back off.\\n#\\n#Do you mean that the \"secular authorities\" are some continuous group of\\n#people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the\\n#Mormons?  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for\\n#nuclear testing etc.. was to \"get them thar Mormons\"?  And what about the\\n#majority of Uthan\\'s who aren\\'t Mormons?  You seem to be searching for enemy\\n ^^^^^^^^\\n(Correction: the majority of Utahn\\'s ARE Mormon (60-70% I believe, up to a\\n 100% in many cities and settlements throughout the Western states.)\\n\\n#conspiracies.  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you\\n#badly must have been done primarily for that purpose.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched, as we believe\\nthat Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert\\ntruth, judgment, and justice.  In addition, we believe that the adversary\\nhas power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be\\na good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and\\nevil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don\\'t you suppose that the\\ndestroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?\\n\\nAs far as Utah is concerned, what I pointed out were some horrible examples\\nof environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which have\\nbrought death, disease, (i.e. the \"downwinders\") and environmental contami-\\nnation.  I am hardly \"paranoid,\" I am just not \"expecting\" too much from a\\nsecular government that may not share our values and faith, and which indeed\\n(as Gov.

After having it awhile\\nI noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there\\nseems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,\\nI have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some\\nrandom 50mV bias.\\n\\tThe other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output\\nwon't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed\\nfrom my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input\\nimpedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have\\nmaximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have\\ninput impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to\\nuse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing\\nreasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my\\ncircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.\\nWith the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now\\nwith this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of\\na pain in  the ass.\\n\\tIs there any way I could make myself a little box that could\\nsolve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator\\ninput, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some\\nlow, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor\\nof one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd\\nlike to have this box not be active.\\n\\tAny quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I\\nhad sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it.

That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor\\nhere to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the\\ncurrent shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing\\nand the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,\\nthis resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the\\nstrings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  \\nOr use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get\\none.

Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon.\\nLines: 170\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: atlantis.csos.orst.edu\\n\\nThis is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction.  If there\\nare no new bids then the current bids stand (like that\\'s gonna  happen.  :) ).\\nAfter this, any updates will be by E-mail *ONLY*.  The entire auction \\nwill end as soon as the bids stop coming in.  So if you want to get in\\non  this, be sure to bid now.  All bids must be made in *AT LEAST*\\n25 cent increments.  Buyer will pay shipping.  (Unless you have any\\nparticular fancy, it will be US mail 4th class special, with lots of\\npadding).  \\nAll dragons are bagged.  The condition of them vary quite a bit, \\nso I\\'ve come up with my own condition system.  Some dragons may be missing \\nitems like the inserts.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.\\n*\\nCondition ratings - Usually this is just an evaluation of the cover, as\\nmost of the material inside is in great shape.\\nExcellent - IE-\"As you find them in the store\"\\nVery Good - Still in great condition, but can tell it\\'s been boughten\\nGood      - On down the line\\nVery Fair/fair - indicates lots of use (But still \"decent\")\\nPoor      -  Indicates the material inside may be damaged (usually by\\nscissors).  \\nA * by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is \\nmissing (usually the insert)\\nI\\'ll post another public update sometime this weekend (which will be the\\nfinal public posting, after which the auction will be by e-mail until\\nthe bidding stops)\\n*\\nAgain if you have any questions, ask away.\\n*\\narrow      $2.50 056 -

Therefore, even if this\\nreligion does not take off, its founding members will be very important\\nhistorically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become \\ncommon.\\n\\nThe basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional\\nmorality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible\\'s\\naccounts of the facts and historical events is correct.\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\nStory of Adam and Eve:\\nAdam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited\\nsupply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says\\nnot to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide \\nin bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.\\n(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in\\nthe bushes that might have angered God.)\\n\\nTraditional Philosophy:\\n1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will\\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it\\'s OK. This\\nis why married women usually didn\\'t work until recent decades.\\n2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \\nand slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without \\nquestion by ordinary people, who can\\'t make decisions for themselves.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:\\nThey were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were\\nobligated to do whatever their \"Father\" said to.  Being forced to leave the \\nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\\n\\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is ideal.  Get-\\nting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.\\n3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.\\n4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and \\nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \\nthemselves.\\n5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from\\nlearning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.\\n\\n1990\\'s philosophy:\\n1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless\\nnamed \"Hillary Clinton\" or \"Murphy Brown\".\\n2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people \\n(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on current philosophy:\\nThey were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge\\nrather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge\\nand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-\\nselves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were \\nREWARDED by being allowed into the \"real world.\"\\n\\nLessons from new interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is at best\\na temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn\\nis ideal.\\n3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.\\n4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and\\nshould consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and \"alter\\nor abolish\" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.\\n5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge\\nbut should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children \\nwithout good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better\\nlife for their children (and themselves).\\n\\nI have tentatively named this new philosophy \"The Church of Eveism\" because\\nEve\\'s decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind\\'s first good decision, instead\\nof its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly\\na protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek \\nknowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the\\ndecision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention\\nand desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it \\nuntil it was actively sought.\\n\\n---End serious discussion.

They are essentially\\ndouble conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.\\nThe receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used\\npreviouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham\\nRadio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.\\n\\n  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used\\nat these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design\\nof this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).\\n\\n  While using this would have let me reduce the \"external\" IF count on\\nreceive, it didn\\'t really offer all that much help on transmit so I\\ndidn\\'t bother with it.\\n\\n  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2\\nMHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios\\nactually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and\\nspeed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data\\nstream is another matter entirely.\\n\\n  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a\\n\"beacon\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow\\ndue to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO\\nalso shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even\\nthough the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes\\nof the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of\\na second.\\n\\n  I\\'ve been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in\\nand get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland\\nIDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the\\nproceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running\\nlow on resources of time, money and energy.\\n\\n  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW\\nID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma\\nMtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally\\npolarized.\\n\\n  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly\\napproach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and\\nyou might want to carefully consider your \"target\".  If you can\\'t\\narrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think\\nyou\\'ll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by\\nmultipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.\\nFor more details, see the 10th CNC.

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \\netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \\nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\\nof Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\\nthat of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\'s treachings, as well as in\\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\\n\\nSAOSHYANT:\\n  The Avestan term saoshyant (\"future benefactor\"; MPers., soshans) designates\\nthe savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind.\\nThe concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro-\\nastrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas.\\nZarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao-\\nshyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present\\nstate of the world, when existence will be \"rehabilitated\" and \"made splendid.\"\\n[See Frashokereti]\\n  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological\\nmyth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors\\nare born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in\\nLake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran),\\nprotected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited\\nSaoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta (\"he who embodies truth\"), the son of\\nthe Vispataurvairi (\"she who conquers all\"), is the third, who will make\\nexistence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will\\nno longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted\\nunlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will\\nbe immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the\\npowerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and\\nof asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and\\nrender it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with\\nthe forces of evil, which will be destroyed.\\n  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation\\n(Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, \"he who makes\\ntruth grow,\" and Ukhshyatnemah, \"he who makes reverence grow\"; the names of the\\nthree virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra\\nwhen they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally\\nspeculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a\\nmillennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will\\nappear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.\\n  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid\\nperiod (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element\\nin the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining\\nfactor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the\\nconfines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha,\\nMaitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace\\nits roots to the same source.\\n', 'From: jburrill@boi.hp.com (Jim Burrill)\\nSubject: Question about Islamic view   \\nOrganization: Idaho River Country, The Salmon, Payette, Clearwater, Boise, Selway, Priest.\\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1.8 PL6]\\nLines: 8\\n\\nA question regarding the Islamic view towards homosexuality came up in a\\ndiscussion group that I participate in, and I\\'d like to ask the question here,\\n\\n\"What is the Islamic view towards homosexuality?\"             \\n\\nJim Burrill\\njburrill@boi.hp.com\\n\\n', 'From: hudson@athena.cs.uga.edu (Paul Hudson Jr)\\nSubject: Re: *** The list of Biblical contradictions\\nOrganization: University of Georgia, Athens\\nLines: 14\\n\\nIn article <bskendigC51CqB.K0r@netcom.com> bskendig@netcom.com (Brian Kendig) writes:\\n\\n>Specifically: when I bring up the fact that Genesis contains two\\n>contradictory creation stories, I usually get blank stares or flat\\n>denials.

A few points need to be clarified:\\n\\nThe Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or\\nthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to\\ncarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the\\nvoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It\\nshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the\\nnormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in\\nthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding\\nconductor.  \\n\\nMuch communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages\\non the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding\\nconductors to provide reliable operation  (\"orange\" outlets are often used for\\nthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in\\nmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read\\nboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on\\ninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated\\ngrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors\\nback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service\\nentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many\\nof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide\\na safe ground or a quiet ground or either. \\n\\nThe GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is\\nreferred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to be\\nwhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in\\nmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance\\npanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household\\nservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which\\nattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  \\n\\nThe Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In\\nthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the\\ncircuit from the panel to the load device.  \\n\\nSince the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding\\nconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance\\nfrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but\\nmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,\\nunder normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the\\ngrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of\\nthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since\\nthere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also\\nno longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment\\nhas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\"\\nground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. \\nThe difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few\\ntenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not\\npresent a shock hazard.  \\n\\nHOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact\\nwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,\\na metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to\\nflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you\\nwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)\\nUnder the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in\\nsome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of\\ninadequate size, causing it to overheat.\\n\\nWith the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a\\nshort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may\\nflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which\\nincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  \\n\\nAlso if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on\\nthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often\\ncausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in\\ntechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.\\n\\nThe Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as\\nwell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for\\nlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back\\nto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded\\nobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses\\nquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the\\ndwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it\\nflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause\\ncorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,\\nand it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop\\nbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the\\nwater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. \\n(don\\'t flame ME on this, I\\'m just telling you where the field comes from, not\\nit\\'s health effect, as far as I\\'m concerned, the jury is still out on this.)\\n\\nNote that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any\\nsub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service\\nentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have\\na seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this\\napplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the\\ngrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding\\nscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above\\nground, with the possible problems listed above.\\n\\nThe code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one\\nbuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be\\nused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate\\nwire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. \\nThese exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days\\nbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don\\'t want to\\nhave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don\\'t want to\\nhave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place\\nof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate\\nneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings\\n(since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, the\\nwires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. \\nSo far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,\\nit\\'s primarily for lightning protection.\\n\\nPeople doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn\\'t a legal grounding\\nconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" \\'with ground\\' is.  Anywhere\\nthere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good\\ngrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes\\nis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under\\nthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this\\naluminum band off at the ends, you don\\'t have to bond it to anything, it does\\nits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall\\ntubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding\\nlocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \\n\\n\"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty\\nsheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn\\'t have\\nthe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and\\ninductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the\\ngreenfield.\\n\\n\"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes\\noften prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is often\\nfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold\\nbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and\\nthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with\\n120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator\\nhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one\\nof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a\\nground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in\\nthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to the\\nbox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.\\n\\nOn another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets\\nwhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them\\nwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the\\nprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don\\'t\\ninstall it.  The interrupter doesn\\'t depend on the ground to trip.  It is\\ndesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is\\nconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,\\nwhereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something\\nprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded\\nGCFI\\'s, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my \\'93\\ncode is in the city, but I know the rule hasn\\'t changed.  It might be\\nrenumbered though.) \\n\\nWe have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more\\nto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.  \\n\\nJohn\\n-- \\n*******************************************************************************\\nJohn H.

They are standard\\n\\t\\tequipment.\\n\\n\\t2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?\\n\\n\\t\\ta)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.

WHy did the FBI not announce \"this window,\\n\\t\\t  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come\\n\\t\\t  down\", and maintain a left to right sequence?\\n\\n\\t\\tb)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when\\n\\t\\t  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)\\n\\t\\t  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to\\n\\t\\t  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long\\n\\t\\t  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend\\n\\t\\t  to ignite.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tWhat other chemicals come up in the forensics?\\n\\t\\t\\tWho else will be allowed to test the site?\\n\\n\\t\\tc)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation\\n\\t\\t  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made\\n\\t\\t  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature\\n\\t\\t  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain\\n\\t\\t  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length\\n\\t\\t  of time (start a wall fire and wait).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tCheck your military records; look at the tapes.\\n\\t\\t\\tWhy were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),\\n\\t\\t\\ttear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why\\n\\t\\t\\tthe hurry. was there still a comm channel open\\n\\t\\t\\tto the outside?).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tDo you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the\\n\\t\\t\\tcompound in the videos?

Some magazines also provide the data on\\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\\ndata on computer disk.\\n\\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\\na \"bingo card\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name\\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\\n\\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer.

After he and his brother Hyram\\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I\\'m led to understand.  Make\\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we\\'re talking about in Smith).  The\\n\\nAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral\\naptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have\\nnothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \"crime\"\\nwas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried\\nto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith\\'s\\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\\n\\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn\\'t of much help\\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\\n\\n\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith\\'s vacancy: he was the senior\\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\\n\\nOther rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\\n\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\\n\\nGranted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling to\\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\\n\\n#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,\\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\\n#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a\\n#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite\\n#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,\\n#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people\\n#had nobody to turn to save themselves.\\n#\\n#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.\\n\\nBTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of\\nthe largest denominations in the country) a \"sect\"???  It didn\\'t \"splinter\"\\nfrom any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.\\n\\n#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very\\n#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They\\'re pledged to defend\\n#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually\\n#>do - even to the point of suicide.)\\n\\nWhat a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am\\nnot comfortable with this alleged \"cosiness\" with Mammon: I assure you\\nthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our\\nONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has\\nappointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about\\nsuicide and \"atone for sins with blood\") is yet another insulting\\nmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...\\n\\n#\\n#        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS\\n#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts\\n#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have\\n#I ever even heard this hinted at.  I\\'m taking it with a salt block.\\n\\nMake it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top.\\n\\n#>  So he hired virtually no one but\\n#>Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the\\n#>Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI\\n#>personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.\\n#>I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI\\'s treatment\\n#>of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.\\n\\nPreposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I\\nam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes\\nof honor and conduct (that\\'s why they were selected for in the\\nfirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith\\nSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all\\npeople are free to worship \"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\"\\n\\n#        If it\\'s true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS\\n#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true\\n#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his\\n#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may\\n#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You\\n#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected\\n#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to\\n#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they\\n#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover\\n#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade\\n#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.\\n#These people are the \"salt of the Earth\" and as such are more\\n#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.\\n\\nA good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people\\nare sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon\\'s \"orders\" (the late\\npresident Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong\\nopposition of the selection of the MX \"Peace Keeper\" missile maze\\nin Utah).\\n\\n#        That\\'s my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have\\n#splinter groups that don\\'t mirror the masses, but these are small\\n#and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.\\n#\\n#        None of this has any relevance to guns, though.

It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at\\n65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be\\nable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)\\nand a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).

I used 3 compariators; each\\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\\n\\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\\ncircuit would not detect it.   \\n\\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.

Be free\\nfrom all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be\\nestablished in the self.\\n  \\n                                PURPORT\\n\\n All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three\\nmodes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which\\ncause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive\\nactivities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of\\nsense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,\\nas a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to\\nthe transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the\\nbeginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme\\ntranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of\\nthe material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get\\nrid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense\\ngratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the\\nchance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the\\nUpanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a\\npart of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the\\nbeginning of transcendental life.\\n\\n As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in\\nthe material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities\\nsuch as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating\\nsuch dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This\\ntranscendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one\\nis fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.\\n\\nBhagavad-Gita As It is\\nBooks of A.C.

I would conclude that science does not have its\\nbasis in values, and so your statement above fails.

A much more likely explanation\\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.

Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.

I purposely used \"handle\" in order to \\navoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are\\naberrations like \"scientific\" creationism).  I used \"best\" in part to indicate \\nthat science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are\\nmostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the\\nmatter.  As an aside, for science I should have written \"how and when\".  Nobody\\nseems to argue over what.\\n\\n>Are they [theists, theologians] any better equiped to investigate the \"who and \\n>why\" than magicians, astrologers, housewives [not being sexists], athiests or \\n>agnostics.\\n\\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I\\'m not\\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\\nperspective on human affairs.

Not that generally they are \\nincapable; they just don\\'t, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to \\nbe the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore \\nit seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for \\ndispensing answers to \"who and why\".  I suggest that this holds regardless of \\nthe \"truth\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  \\nIn the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \"real\" as scientific facts and \\nexplanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  \\n\\n>Do you suggest that the \"who and why\" will forever be closed to scientific \\n>investigation?\\n\\nNo.  In fact, I don\\'t think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. \\nIsn\\'t there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was \\ncreated from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might \\npresuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued \\nthat something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn\\'t\\nhave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that\\'s a tough one for\\npeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not \\nexplanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, \\nI agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific \\nas explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but \\nI sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will \\nbe necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty \\nconvoluted here; I hope I\\'ve made sense.  \\n\\n>It seems to me that 200 or so years ago, the question of the origin of life on\\n>earth was not considered open to scientific enquiry.\\n\\nI agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, \\nwhen, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, \\nreason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, \\nand not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the \\nnaturalists\\' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely \\nleaving behind the who and why.

The noise you hear is due to the momentary\\nopening and closing of the path.\\n\\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristic\\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\\nthe audio.\\n\\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\\nimpedance.\\n\\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\\n\\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \"Make before\\nbreak and Vica Versa\" but I haven\\'t seen any of these for years.\\n\\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\\n\\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \"optical isolator\"..

The\\nprogram was described by these men as \"ineffective . . . not one person was\\nhealed.\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent\\nfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were\\ndriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \"reparative therapy.\"\\n\\nThe previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June\\n30, 1992 called \"The Ex-Ex-Gay\" by Robert Pela.\\n\\nSome personal thoughts:\\n\\nIt is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major\\nportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among\\nits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all\\nthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to\\nsave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even\\nlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and\\nsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.\\nToday\\'s scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is\\nstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind\\ncontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than\\nGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt\\nthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \"physically\" forced\\nto stay in this \"reparative therapy\" but sheer social pressure is enough for\\nmany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.\\n\\nAs an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution\\nagainst gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by\\nthe contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,\\nnot by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven\\';t\\na clue what is in their heart.\\n\\nFor those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them\\nplease contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians\\nAnd Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of\\npeople comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends\\nwho have formed a support group for help and understanding.

As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases\\nand hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output\\nvoltage as possible. (about 260v).\\n  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages\\n(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v\\nacross them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.\\n  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.\\n If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will\\nincrease the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.\\nThese capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of\\nthem, So:\\n\\n1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel \\nwith the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?\\n  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase\\nthe RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more\\nstable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...\\nas I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new\\ncapacitor will \\'smooth\\' this out.\\n\\nand\\n2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to\\nbe placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out\\nthe 50Hz mains hum.

I\\'m not a Jew but I understand that this is the\\nJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between\\nYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral\\nCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\\nfall, though.\\n\\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).\\n\\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\\n\\n>\\n>The first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created\\n>in His image, so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever\\n>moral code He follows as part of trying to live up to that image.

I\\'ve heard a number of different opinions on this and\\nhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if\\none wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors\\nunashamedly!) As to living by Christ\\'s example, we know very little about\\nJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives\\nby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.\\nRevelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse.\\n\\nThis is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way\\ninitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible\\nto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity.

There are undoubtably multiple\\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\\nyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\\nas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:\\n\\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\\nAs they swam its clearness through.\\n\\n', 'From: bmaraldo@watserv1.uwaterloo.ca (Commander Brett Maraldo)\\nSubject: Ampex 456 2\" Recording Tape For Sale\\nOrganization: University of Waterloo\\nDistribution: na\\nLines: 19\\n\\n\\n\\tI have 5 full reels of Ampex 456 2\" recording tape.

In other\\n>words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday\\n>as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus.\\n\\nI think the passage you\\'re looking for is the following.\\n\\nMatthew 5:17    \"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the \\nprophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. \\nMatthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, \\nnot an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. \\nMatthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments \\nand teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he \\nwho does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of \\nheaven. \\nMatthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of \\nthe scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. \\n\\nThere are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the\\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus\\' death was what to do\\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\\nimpose the Law on them didn\\'t say that the Law was abolished.  It\\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  This\\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\\nin Acts 15.)\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent\\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of\\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\\nissue isn\\'t one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\\nassures us that that\\'s not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an impossible standard, and one that\\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s\\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s important that it not be\\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not the end -- ultimately we\\nlive in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\\nto give Paul so much trouble.\\n\\nIt\\'s unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\\nvalues.\\n', 'From: ravin@eecg.toronto.edu (Govindan Ravindran)\\nSubject: decoupling caps - onboard\\nOrganization: Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto\\nLines: 10\\n\\n(posted for a friend)\\nhello there,\\n        I would like to know if any one had any experience with having\\non-board decoupling capacitors (inside a cmos chip) for the power\\nlines.

Our current automation\\nconsoles date from the early 60\\'s and don\\'t provide this function.\\n\\nWe already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,\\nand our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control\\ncircuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the\\ncue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there\\'s one\\nproblem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be\\na sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,\\nso to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid\\ncuetape!)\\n\\nIdeally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.\\n(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)\\nThis would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.\\nWhat I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay\\nfor around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay\\nis activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit\\nof some sort.

It is very unlikely, however,\\n   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\\n\\nNot possible either.  You\\'d need about a 300 amp alternator for\\njust the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow\\ndown on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.\\n\\n   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt\\n   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet \\n   away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\\n   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be \\n   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\\n   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \\n   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\\n   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\\n   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\\n\\n   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\\n   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\\n   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\\n   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\\n   Good instructions are included with the chokes.\\n   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\\n   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\\n   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\\n   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.\\n\\nAnd please remember to be friendly when approaching your\\nlocal radio operator.  This person may or may not be the \\ncause of your troubles,  and you\\'ll get better cooperation\\nand help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most\\nare).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes\\ndealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost\\npictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.\\ninterferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  \\n\\nBTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or\\nnot he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of\\nbeing a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.\\nToo bad they don\\'t require the consumer equipment makers\\nto take any precautions.\\n\\nLast, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are\\nrequired to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more\\nthan 10).  So if you hear \"This is WA1QT\" or some other call starting\\nwith A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.\\nCB\\'ers probably won\\'t sign (I don\\'t know that they\\'re even required\\nto) and fire/police have other private ids.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\nDouglas S.

When he included that bit\\nfrom Merlinus X\\' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss\\' background, but surely\\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \\nfor many years.\\n\\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\\n\\n\\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\\n\\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \\nKellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition of\\nthe \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean\\nan \"air core resonant transformer\". The TV flyback version Tesla\\ncoil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for\\ndiagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called\\n\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\" (OSC). Generally OSC\\'s are highly\\nefficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,\\nwhich are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active\\nreactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve\\nefficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core\\nresonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI\\nfor wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer\\nscreen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil\\nfrom it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all\\nTesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter\\nand die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind\\nto a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,\\ngas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and\\ntelegraph for communication.

The issues are the same regardless of where the \\nheat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in\\norder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is\\nnormally water\\'s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is\\ndesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because \\nmoisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine \\nlow pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity\\ncauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest\\npressure condensing environment is always the best.  \\n\\nA related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where\\nthe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the\\ncondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the \\ncondensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too \\nhot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into\\nsteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a\\nparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all\\ncosts.  \\n\\nThe hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant\\nin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower \\nthey must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in\\nthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 \\ndegrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is\\nused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower\\nsystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water\\nis pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,\\noperators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order \\nto provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher\\nhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the\\ncondenser area.\\n\\nAt least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the\\nair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge\\nwater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water\\nfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and\\nhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water\\ntemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical\\n\"95-95\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.\\nIt is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful\\nin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the\\nplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets\\ntoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive\\npressure.\\n\\n>       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.

But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you\\nhave produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug\\ndeeper.  I\\'m glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on\\nthese passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as\\nevidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it\\noften enough:\\n \\n> (a) the text itself\\n> (b) parallel passages\\n> (c) other pertinent Scriptures\\n> (d) historical context\\n> (e) historical content\\n> (f) other pertinent historical info\\n> (g) cultural context\\n> (h) cultural content\\n> (i) other pertinent cultural info\\n> (j) grammatical construction\\n> (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies\\n> (l) etc.\\n \\nBut are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let\\'s\\nsee, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other\\npassages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has\\npresented no use of:\\n \\n(d) historical context                or\\n(e) historical content                or\\n(f) other pertinent historical info   or\\n(g) cultural context                  or\\n(h) cultural content                  or\\n(i) other pertinent cultural info     or\\n(j) grammatical construction          or even\\n(k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don\\'t count]\\n \\nThus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nQuestion:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting\\nto use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present\\nshallow observations (I don\\'t mean this in a bad way).\\nAt this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a\\ntotal exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating\\naround the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe\\nit necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:\\nJudas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use\\nseveral of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also.\\nIt will greatly enhance our study of these passages.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other\\npassage.

You claim that the\\nPASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one\\nanother.\\n(1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;\\n(2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas\\' death, as you claim.

Many people point to the apparent\\ndiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.\\nSome have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is\\ndestroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at\\nall.\\nMatthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and\\nwas crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do\\nthey necessarily contradict each other?\\nMatthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that\\nJudas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling\\nsomething black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be\\ntrue and supplementary.\\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\\nthis way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are\\nnot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\\nwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.\\nLouis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.\\nThis individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a\\npistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at\\nthe same time.\\nOn the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting\\nhimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping\\nform the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the\\ncase of Matthew\\'s and Peter\\'s accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a\\nsituation of different perspectives of the same event.\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n \\nYour only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit\\ninerrancy.  You haven\\'t related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.\\nHere\\'s what you said in an earlier post...\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nDB [quoting Tony Rose]...\\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\n> Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks\\n> on this way down, tearing his body open.

I ask you again to provide evidence that Matthew stated Judas\\n>     died in the hanging.\\n> (2) You claim that the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew that Judas threw down\\n>     in the temple and the chief priests used, is the \"reward of iniquity\"\\n>     in Acts that pictures Judas in some way purchasing a field with;\\n>     therefore there is a contradiction.  Prove that the 30 pieces of silver\\n>     and the \"reward of iniquity\" are one and the same.\\n \\nActually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer\\nit because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out\\nthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a\\nbit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy\\nmovies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nI work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.

I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM\\nshow teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]\\n \\nDB...\\n\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other\\nqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nQualifiers are important at times, as we\\'ll see in an OT passage I\\'ll mention\\nbelow.\\nDoes hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we\\nhave re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it\\'s\\nsynonymous means it has the same meaning as.

Most scholars believe he probably did, but...?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n______________________________________________________________________\\n \\nI quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars\\' explanations, but\\nin looking at the texts initially, we can\\'t assume Judas died.  It is, however,\\nhighly probable.                            ^^^^^^\\n \\nDB...\\n\"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had\\ndifferent ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One\\nsimply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew\\'s version as\\nthe correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\"\\nsuggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly\\nexploded (which doesn\\'t explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope\\nbroke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn\\'t explain\\nhow a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nThe outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person\\nwas suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may\\nhave deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell\\nupon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a\\nsuperficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not\\ngiven a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted\\npost gave us some...\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\\nthis way down, tearing his body open.\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n \\nDB...\\nNow truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the\\nsource of the Potter\\'s field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is\\ncorrect: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist\\nwho claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to\\nthereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the\\nprophesy of the Potter\\'s field came from).\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nPlease, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\\nthis with you.\\n \\nDB...\\nAs to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\\nmoney with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\\nthan some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\\nmention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\\nwhat act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\\nJudas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\\nthat when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\\ndiscusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\\nit was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nDave, we are getting somewhere, aren\\'t we!\\n \\nACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples\\n(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,\\nACT 1:16 \"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy\\nSpirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide\\nto those who arrested Jesus;\\nACT 1:17 \"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\"\\nACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and\\nfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\\nACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field\\nis called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)\\nACT 1:20 \"For it is written in the book of Psalms: \\'Let his dwelling place be\\ndesolate, And let no one live in it\\'; and, \\'Let another take his office.\\'\\n \\nNotice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\\nthat Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\\nBut the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\\nobtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\\n         ^^^^^^\\nJOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a\\nthief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.\\nJOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had\\nsaid to him, \"Buy those things we need for the feast,\" or that he should give\\nsomething to the poor.\\n \\nSo, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.\\nRight after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,\\naccording to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \"wages of\\niniquity\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen\\nby Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical\\nexplanation of what the \"wages of iniquity\" are.

The above mentioned verse from the Qur\\'an is from \\nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\\n\\n\\tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men,\\n\\tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\\n\\tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\\n\\tall things.\\n\\n---------------------\\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \\nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\\nAllah\\'s teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later\\nages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not\\nan arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,\\n\"for Allah has full knowledge of all things.\"\\n\\n----------------------\\nDROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2\\n\\nA   D R O P L E T\\nFrom The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur\\'an\\n\\nTranslations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of \\nBediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor\\n\\nVOL 1, No 11, Part 2\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   \\t\\t NINETEENTH LETTER  \\n\\n\\t\\t MU\\'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI \\n(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       \\n\\n(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)\\n\\n   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)\\ndeclared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a\\ndecree as the Glorious Qur\\'an and manifest miracles\\nwhich number, according to the scholars, one thousand.\\nThe occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as\\ncertain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In\\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\\nOur\\'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \\nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\\neffect of the words,\\'You have indeed spoken the truth !\\'\\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\\nwhile being observed by Him, \\'The true ruler has\\nappointed me to such and such position.  \\'At a time when\\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word \\'Yes\\'\\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\\nand more definitely than would the word \\'Yes.\\'\\n   In the same way, ALLAH\\'s Most Noble Messenger\\nclaimed: \\'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  \\'Further he shows\\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\\nmerely by seeing him, and said, \\'No lie can hide in this\\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!\\'\\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\\nways.\\n   The Wise Our\\'an alone demonstrates thousands of\\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\nTo be Continued Allah Willing.\\nIrfan Alan, A Servant of Islam.\\n\\n', 'From: ch981@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Tony Alicea)\\nSubject: Re: Rosicrucian Order(s) ?!\\nOrganization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH (USA)\\nLines: 21\\nReply-To: ch981@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Tony Alicea)\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: hela.ins.cwru.edu\\n\\n\\nIn a previous article, cdcolvin@rahul.net (Christopher D.

If\\n\\tyou\\'re at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don\\'t\\n\\tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,\\n\\tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;\\n\\tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.\\n\\n\\tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National\\n\\tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).\\n\\tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail\\n\\twith the electrical code, but we don\\'t quote sections\\n\\tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we\\'re wrong,\\n\\twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!\\n\\n\\tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the\\n\\tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,\\n\\thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building\\n\\tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in\\n\\tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,\\n\\tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements\\n\\tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that\\n\\twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family\\n\\tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial\\n\\testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different\\n\\trules.\\n\\n\\tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in\\n\\tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary\\n\\tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.\\n\\tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line\\n\\tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number\\n\\tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we\\'ve\\n\\tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC\\'\\' or\\n\\t``CEC\\'\\'.\\n\\n\\tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often\\n\\tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.\\n\\nSubject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?\\n\\n\\tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the\\n\\tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.\\n\\tIt\\'s revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.\\n\\tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly\\n\\tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There\\'s the\\n\\tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There\\'s an abridged\\n\\tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.\\n\\tAnd there\\'s the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized\\n\\tcommentary\\'\\' on the code, as well as the full text.  That\\'s the\\n\\trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there\\'s no handbook for\\n\\tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --\\n\\tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.\\n\\nSubject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?\\n\\n\\tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up\\n\\tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance\\n\\tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.\\n\\tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two\\n\\tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,\\n\\tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book.\\n\\tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified\\n\\tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA\\n\\tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the\\n\\tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is\\n\\tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th\\n\\tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th\\n\\tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an\\n\\tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.\\n\\n\\tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical\\n\\tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In\\n\\tOntario, it\\'s Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn\\'t\\n\\toverly fat.  It\\'s about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I\\n\\thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the\\n\\tequivalent NEC publications.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout\\n\\tthe province.\\n\\nSubject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?\\n\\n\\tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.\\n\\tIn some, they\\'re not.  Check with your local electrical\\n\\tinspector.  Most places won\\'t permit you to do wiring on other\\'s\\n\\thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do\\n\\twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)\\n\\tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However,\\n\\tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial\\n\\twiring if you\\'re supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can\\n\\tfind one willing to supervise.\\n\\n\\tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:\\n\\n\\tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better\\n\\tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it\\'s your own home,\\n\\tand it\\'s you or your family that might get killed if you make\\n\\ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills\\n\\tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.\\n\\tIn this FAQ we\\'ve consciously given a few recommendations that\\n\\tare in excess of code, because we feel that it\\'s reasonable,\\n\\tand will impress the inspector.\\n\\n\\tThe inspector will know that you\\'re an amateur.  You have to\\n\\tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your\\n\\ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don\\'t cut corners.\\n\\tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely\\n\\tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t try to hide anything from the inspector.\\n\\n\\tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don\\'t use a bread knife to strip\\n\\twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector\\n\\twon\\'t like it, and the results won\\'t be that safe.  And it\\n\\ttakes longer.  And you\\'re more likely to stick a hunk of\\n\\t12ga wire through your hand that way.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t handle house wire when it\\'s very cold (eg: below -10C\\n\\tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types\\n\\tbecome very brittle.\\n\\nSubject: What do I need in the way of tools?\\n\\n\\tFirst, there\\'s the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few\\n\\tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you\\'re \\n\\tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved\\n\\tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers\\n\\t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.\\n\\n\\tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or\\n\\t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you\\'re doing a lot, or\\n\\tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill\\n\\t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and\\n\\t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull\\n\\tyou through, so they\\'re much faster and less fatiguing, even\\n\\tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.\\n\\n\\tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you\\n\\tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws\\n\\twork well).\\n\\t\\n\\tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or\\n\\tordinary wire cutters.  Don\\'t buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper,\\n\\tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay\\n\\t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized\\n\\tstripping holes, and won\\'t nick or grab the wire - it should\\n\\tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the\\n\\tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There\\n\\tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren\\'t\\n\\tnecessary, and pros usually don\\'t use them.\\n\\n\\tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends\\n\\tin constricted places.  Don\\'t use these for stripping wire.\\n\\n\\tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.\\n\\n\\tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling\\n\\tinside boxes and closing loops, but it\\'s better to form wire\\n\\tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more\\n\\taccurate.\\n\\n\\tIf you\\'re using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for\\n\\tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the\\n\\tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,\\n\\tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a\\n\\t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn\\'t try to strip\\n\\tthe sheath with a knife point, because it\\'s too easy to\\n\\tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley\\n\\tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)\\n\\tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility\\n\\tthat you\\'ll gouge the conductors.\\n\\n\\tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it\\'s well\\n\\tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).\\n\\tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire\\n\\tor the insulation.\\n\\n\\tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired\\n\\toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more\\n\\texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple\\n\\tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated\\n\\twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost\\n\\tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.\\n\\n\\tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are\\n\\tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)\\n\\tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is\\n\\tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I\\'ve been known\\n\\tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)\\n\\n\\tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.\\n\\tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or\\n\\ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.\\n\\n\\tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent\\n\\twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for\\n\\twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap \\n\\taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination\\n\\tscrews - I don\\'t do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to\\n\\tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet\\n\\tthat has no cover plate).\\n\\nSubject: What is UL listing?\\n\\n\\tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be\\n\\tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent\\n\\tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment\\n\\tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means\\n\\tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements\\n\\tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn\\'t necessarily\\n\\tmean that the device actually does what it\\'s supposed to, just\\n\\tthat it probably won\\'t kill you.\\n\\n\\tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are\\n\\tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,\\n\\tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will\\n\\tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to\\n\\tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in\\n\\tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component\\n\\tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.\\n\\tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring\\n\\tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or\\n\\toccupancy permits issued.\\n\\t\\nSubject: What is CSA approval?\\n\\n\\tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the\\n\\tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in\\n\\tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done\\n\\twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to\\n\\tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is\\n\\trequired by law.\\n\\n\\tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved\\n\\tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the\\n\\tclaim.\\n\\n\\tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC\\n\\t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to\\n\\tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance\\n\\tcompanies.\\n\\nSubject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?\\n\\n\\tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers\\n\\n\\t    Residential Wiring\\n\\t    by Jeff Markell,\\n\\t    Craftsman Books,\\n\\t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25.

Knight authors and publishes a book called\\n\\t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version\\n\\tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the\\n\\tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,\\n\\tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY\\'ers.  It is better to get\\n\\tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer\\n\\tquestions on the net ;-).\\n\\n\\tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is\\n\\tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.\\n\\nSubject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?\\n\\n\\tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and\\n\\tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more\\n\\tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not\\n\\tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections\\n\\tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors\\n\\tor subsequent owners of your home don\\'t get killed or lose\\n\\ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.\\n\\n\\tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your\\n\\thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a\\n\\tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about\\n\\tthis.\\n\\n\\tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at\\n\\tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage\\n\\tclaims.\\n\\n\\tIn general, the process goes like this:\\n\\t\\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building\\n\\t\\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or\\n\\t\\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is\\n\\t\\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you\\'re not\\n\\t\\t  sure of.  If you\\'re doing major work, they may impose\\n\\t\\t  special conditions on you, require loading\\n\\t\\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point\\n\\t\\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need.\\n\\t\\t- If you\\'re installing a main panel, you will need to\\n\\t\\t  have the panel and service connections inspected\\n\\t\\t  before your power utility will provide a connection.\\n\\t\\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority\\n\\t\\t  rather than the usual inspectors.\\n\\t\\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before\\n\\t\\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a\\n\\t\\t  \"rough-in\" inspection.\\n\\t\\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,\\n\\t\\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".\\n\\nSubject: My house doesn\\'t meet some of these rules and regulations.\\n\\tDo I have to upgrade?\\n\\n\\tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,\\n\\tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some\\n\\tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the\\n\\tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major\\'\\' work, you\\n\\tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all\\n\\tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.\\n\\nSubject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240\\n\\n\\tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the\\n\\tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of\\n\\ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V\\n\\tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same\\n\\tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required\\n\\tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.\\n\\tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there\\n\\tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it\\'s not\\n\\tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped\\n\\tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially\\n\\tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number\\n\\tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,\\n\\tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers.\\n\\tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and\\n\\t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will\\n\\tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.\\n\\n\\tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable\\n\\tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V\\n\\tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device\\n\\tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that\\n\\tlow.\\n\\n\\t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between\\n\\tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any\\n\\thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\"\\n\\tcircuit that\\'s 277V from hot to neutral.\\n\\n\\tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended\\n\\tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...\\n\\nSubject: What does an electrical service look like?\\n\\n\\tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the\\n\\tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility\\n\\tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.\\n\\n \\tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded\\n \\tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes\\n \\tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where\\n\\tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic\\n\\taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)).\\n\\tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that\\n\\tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire\\n\\tnormally carries no current.\\n\\n\\tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or\\n\\tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.\\n\\tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the\\n\\tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It\\n\\tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often\\n\\tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected\\n\\tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.\\n\\n\\tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in\\n\\ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.\\n\\tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral\\n\\tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional\\n\\tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house\\n\\twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.\\n\\n\\tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually\\n\\tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are\\n\\tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one\\n\\tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations \\n\\t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do\\n\\thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your\\n\\tinspector.\\n\\n\\tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\"\\n\\twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as\\n\\twell.\\n\\n\\tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each\\n\\tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,\\n\\tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the\\n\\twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.\\n\\n\\tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.\\n\\tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected\\n\\ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one\\n\\twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some\\n\\trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only\\n\\tservice).\\n\\nSubject: What is a circuit?\\n\\n\\tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.\\n\\tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected\\n\\tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations:\\n\\t\\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.\\n\\t\\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.\\n\\t\\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,\\n\\t\\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.\\n\\n\\t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and\\n\\tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying\\n\\tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they\\n\\toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several\\n\\tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is\\n\\tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or\\n\\tair conditioners.\\n\\n\\t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar\\n\\tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there\\n\\tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral\\n\\tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing\\n\\tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead\\n\\tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.\\n\\tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles\\n\\tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but\\n\\tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,\\n\\tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to\\n\\tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is\\n\\tpermissible.]\\n\\n\\t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,\\n\\twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.\\n\\n\\t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a\\n\\tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.\\n\\n\\tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground\\n\\twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC\\n\\trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends\\n\\tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail\\n\\tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.\\n\\n\\tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the\\n\\tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.\\n\\n\\tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)\\n\\tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places\\n\\trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\",\\n\\tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an\\n\\talternative to GFCI protection.\\n\\nSubject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".\\n\\n\\tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the\\n\\t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green\\n\\tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when\\n\\tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white\\n\\twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the\\n\\tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the\\n\\tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding\\n\\tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should\\n\\tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire\\n\\tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected\\n\\ttogether in the panel.\\n\\n\\t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground\\n\\tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]\\n\\n\\tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used\\n\\tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to\\n\\tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\"\\n\\ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light\\n\\tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.\\n\\nSubject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?\\n\\n\\tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power\\n\\tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For\\n\\texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should\\n\\t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As\\n\\tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the\\n\\twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the\\n\\tequipment itself won\\'t cause a fire.\\n\\n\\tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt\\n\\t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby\\n\\tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively\\n\\tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have\\n\\tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use\\n\\ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid\\n\\ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a\\n\\tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be\\n\\treplaced.\\n\\n\\tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They\\n\\tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched\\n\\tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow\\n\\tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip\\n\\theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the\\n\\tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave\\n\\tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to\\n\\ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high\\n\\toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite\\n\\tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown\\n\\twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which\\n\\tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in\\n\\tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the\\n\\tpurpose.\\n\\n\\tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead\\n\\tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even\\n\\tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which\\n\\tcan often cause severe damage.\\n\\nSubject: Breakers?  Can\\'t I use fuses?\\n\\n\\tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher\\n\\trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually\\n\\tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts\\n\\tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse\\n\\tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a\\n\\tpenny\" trick.\\n\\n\\tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better\\n\\tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.\\n\\n\\tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When\\n\\ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting\\n\\tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,\\n\\tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical\\n\\tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down.\\n\\tBreakers don\\'t do this.\\n\\n\\tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit\\n\\tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new\\n\\tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special\\n\\tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)\\n\\n\\tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse\\n\\tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse\\n\\tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the\\n\\tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently\\n\\tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you\\n\\tif you need one.\\n\\nSubject: What size wire should I use?\\n\\n\\tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,\\n\\tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,\\n\\tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid\\n\\tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than\\n\\t14 gauge, though it\\'s stiffer and harder to work with.\\n\\n\\tHere\\'s a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for\\n\\tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or\\n\\tganged with other wires in a place where they can\\'t dissipate\\n\\theat easily:\\n\\n\\t\\tGauge\\t\\tAmps\\n\\t\\t14\\t\\t15\\n\\t\\t12\\t\\t20\\n\\t\\t10\\t\\t30\\n\\t\\t8\\t\\t40\\n\\t\\t6\\t\\t65\\n\\t\\n\\tWe don\\'t list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent\\n\\ton the application and precise wire type.\\n\\nSubject: Where do these numbers come from?\\n\\n\\tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.\\n\\tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When\\n\\tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is\\n\\tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need\\n\\thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in\\n\\tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long\\n\\truns.\\n\\n\\tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances.\\n\\tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller\\n\\twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most\\n\\tlamps.  Don\\'t try this unless you\\'re certain that your use fits\\n\\tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger\\n\\twire.\\n\\nSubject: What does \"14-2\" mean?\\n\\n\\tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors\\n\\tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second\\n\\tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but\\n\\tremember there\\'s usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means\\n\\t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.\\n\\n\\t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes\\n\\tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In\\n\\tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.\\n\\n\\t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.\\n\\tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.\\n\\nSubject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they\\n\\tused?\\n\\n\\tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that\\'s used\\n\\tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\"\\n\\tare trade names.  You\\'ll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.\\n\\n\\tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them\\n\\ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.\\n\\n\\tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don\\'t need to twist the\\n\\twire, do it anyways - it\\'s more mechanically and electrically\\n\\tsecure.\\n\\n\\tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check\\n\\tthat the wire nut you\\'re using is the correct size for the\\n\\tquantity and sizes of wire you\\'re connecting together.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or\\n\\tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers,\\n\\tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes\\n\\tit\\'s a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it\\n\\tgoes in the wirenut properly.\\n\\n\\tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical\\n\\ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may\\n\\ttear it off during an inspection.  It\\'s usually done because\\n\\ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead\\n\\tof taping it, the connection should be redone.\\n\\nSubject: What is a GFI/GFCI?\\n\\n\\tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter\\'\\'.  It measures\\n\\tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the\\n\\tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the\\n\\tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other\\n\\tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of\\n\\tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any\\n\\tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking\\n\\tthe circuit.\\n\\n\\tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,\\n\\tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral\\n\\tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI\\n\\twouldn\\'t help.  All of the current that passed from the hot\\n\\tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the\\n\\tGFCI happy.\\n\\n\\tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.\\n\\tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed\\n\\t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be\\n\\tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices\\n\\tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be\\n\\tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.\\n\\nSubject: Where should GFCIs be used?\\n\\n\\tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase\\n\\toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6\\' of the sink, garages,\\n\\tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or\\n\\tjust about anywhere else where you\\'re likely to encounter water\\n\\tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,\\n\\tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space\\'\\',\\n\\ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and\\n\\tlaundry appliances.\\n\\n\\tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there\\n\\tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or\\n\\tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you\\n\\thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they\\'re near the door to\\n\\toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.\\n\\n\\tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may\\n\\twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI\\n\\tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI\\n\\toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in\\n\\tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your\\n\\tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?\\n\\tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does\\n\\twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?\\n\\nSubject: Where shouldn\\'t I use a GFCI?\\n\\n\\tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don\\'t pose a\\n\\tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run\\n\\tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,\\n\\tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs\\n\\tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that\\n\\tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary\\n\\tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most\\n\\tGFCI trips are real; if you\\'re getting a lot of trips for no\\n\\tapparent reason, you\\'d be well-advised to check your wiring\\n\\tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.\\n\\nSubject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?\\n\\n\\tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the\\n\\tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with\\n\\ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI\\n\\tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE\\n\\tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one\\n\\tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch\\n\\tcircuit\\'\\' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),\\n\\tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you\\'ll need a\\n\\tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;\\n\\tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on\\n\\twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such\\n\\ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.\\n\\n\\tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use\\n\\tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use\\n\\tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You\\'ll thank yourself for it.\\n\\n\\tIncidentally, if you\\'re installing a GFCI to ensure that one\\n\\tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don\\'t\\n\\treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first\\n\\toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet\\n\\tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But\\n\\tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.\\n\\n\\tWhen you install a GFCI, it\\'s a good idea to use the little\\n\\t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark\\n\\tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which\\n\\toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the\\n\\ttest button and see which outlets are dead.\\n\\nSubject: What\\'s the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?\\n\\n\\tApart from their use in electronics, which we won\\'t comment on,\\n\\tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won\\'t turn on without\\n\\ta good ground connection), they\\'re intended to guard against\\n\\tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of\\n\\tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there\\'s an\\n\\tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the\\n\\tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly\\n\\ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not\\n\\tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if\\n\\tyou touch it while you\\'re grounded, you\\'ll get zapped.  Of\\n\\tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very\\n\\ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace\\n\\tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).\\n\\n\\tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In\\n\\tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with\\n\\texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating\\n\\telectrode in a toaster, and you\\'re not grounded, nothing will\\n\\thappen.  If you\\'re slightly grounded, you\\'ll get a small shock;\\n\\tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were\\n\\tgrounded, and you were holding it, you\\'d be the perfect path to\\n\\tground...\\n\\nSubject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization\\n\\n\\tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the\\n\\tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)\\n\\ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.\\n\\tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the\\n\\tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to\\n\\thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).\\n\\n\\tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.\\n\\n\\tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right\\n\\tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the\\n\\tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the\\n\\thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.\\n\\tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which\\n\\tprong the terminating screw connects to.\\n\\nSubject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?\\n\\n\\tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance\\n\\tcircuits\\'\\' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex\\n\\treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more\\n\\tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider\\n\\tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.\\n\\tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except\\n\\tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits\\n\\tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,\\n\\tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6\\' of a sink *must* be\\n\\tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).\\n\\n\\tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab\\n\\tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to\\n\\tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.\\n\\tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When\\n\\t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be\\n\\tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral\\n\\tconnection fall off doesn\\'t cause the neutral to disconnect\\n\\tfrom downstream outlets.\\n\\nSubject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?\\n\\n\\tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to\\n\\tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in\\n\\tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.\\n\\nSubject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?\\n\\n\\tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.\\n\\tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.\\n\\tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside\\n\\tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject\\n\\tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are\\n\\twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several\\n\\tdifferent categories of NM cable.\\n\\n\\tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a\\n\\tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is\\n\\tfairly resistant to damage.\\n\\n\\tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic\\n\\tsheath.\\n\\t\\n\\tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable\\n\\tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer\\n\\tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC)\\n\\tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected\\n\\tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of\\n\\tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.\\n\\n\\t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored\\n\\tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,\\n\\tbut this is technically illegal.]\\n\\n\\tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the\\n\\tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague\\n\\treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC\\n\\tand CEC):\\n\\n\\t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage\\n\\t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls\\n\\t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.\\n\\t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.\\n\\t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces\\n\\t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian\\n\\t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet\\n\\t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable\\n\\t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance.\\n\\t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.\\n\\t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating\\n\\t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by\\n\\t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation\\n\\t      material (a wad of fiberglass).\\n\\t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1\\' of every box\\n\\t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5\\'.\\n\\t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\".\\n\\t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to\\n\\t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,\\n\\t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical]\\n\\t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.\\n\\t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring\\n\\t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured\\n\\t      in the breach...]\\n\\t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or\\n\\t      similar finish.\\n\\t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.\\n\\t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists\\n\\t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more\\n\\t      than 1m (39\").\\n\\n\\tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small\\n\\tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to\\n\\tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through\\n\\tthe insulation.\\n\\n\\tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by\\n\\tsolid wall coverings.\\n\\n\\tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of\\n\\ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a\\n\\tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of\\n\\tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the\\n\\twire.\\n\\n\\tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.\\n\\n\\tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will\\n\\tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like\\n\\tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of\\n\\tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground\\n\\twiring section.]\\n\\n \\tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be\\n \\texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that\\n \\tpurpose.\\n\\n\\tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through\\n\\tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed\\n\\tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this\\n\\tis that if there\\'s a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses\\n\\tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building.\\n\\tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.\\n\\t\\n \\tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,\\n \\texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the\\n \\ttemperature rating in Celsius.

The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box\\n\\titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic\\n\\tboxes don\\'t use metal cable clamps.\\n\\n\\tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable\\n\\tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still\\n\\tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also\\n\\trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.\\n\\n\\tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for\\n\\tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground\\n\\tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other\\n\\thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For\\n\\texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.\\n\\nSubject: Junction box positioning?\\n\\n\\tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.\\n\\n\\tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they\\'re accessible\\n\\tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction\\n\\tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may\\n\\tget nasty.\\n\\nSubject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?\\n\\n\\tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few\\n\\tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage\\n\\trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half\\n\\ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire\\n\\tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle\\n\\tconstraints as well.  For example, older house\\n\\twiring doesn\\'t have high-temperature insulation.  The excess\\n\\theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the\\n\\tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.\\n\\tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high\\n\\ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your\\n\\tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case\\n\\treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)\\n\\n\\tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some\\n\\tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and\\n\\tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy\\n\\tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box\\n\\tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling\\n\\tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available\\n\\tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and\\n\\tmounted between the joists.\\n\\n\\tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as\\n\\t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated\\n\\tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.\\n\\tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated\\n\\tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually\\n\\t8\\'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering\\n\\twith plywood) that doesn\\'t have any insulation.  (Yes, that\\'s 8 *feet*\\n\\tlong)\\n\\n\\tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\"\\n\\tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.\\n\\tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,\\n\\twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin\\'\\' might be worthwhile.\\n\\tPresumably, that\\'s up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn\\'t\\n\\tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector\\n\\trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can\\'t get\\n\\taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown\\n\\tin later.]\\n\\n\\tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and\\n\\tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are\\n\\tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat\\n\\tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should\\n\\tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.\\n\\tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location\\n\\tfor the sensor can vary.\\n\\n\\tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved\\n\\tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.\\n\\nSubject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?\\n\\n\\tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is\\n\\tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up\\n\\tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with\\n\\trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can\\n\\tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in\\n\\tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions\\n\\trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).\\n\\n\\tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately\\n\\tand have them come and check out the problem.\\n\\n\\tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with\\n\\tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A\\n\\tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness\\n\\tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.\\n\\nSubject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?\\n\\n\\tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of\\n\\tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors\\n\\tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque,\\n\\tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.\\n\\n\\tYou\\'re most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows\\n\\t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between\\n\\tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal\\n\\t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the\\n\\ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.\\n\\n\\tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually\\n\\tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you\\n\\twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to\\n\\tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is\\n\\tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have\\n\\ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a\\n\\t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if\\n\\tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to\\n\\treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop\\'\\' has an\\n\\tarticle on how to do this if you must.\\n\\n\\tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using\\n\\tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.\\n\\nSubject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?\\n\\n\\tTheoretically, it doesn\\'t make any difference.  However, there\\n\\tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply\\n\\twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times\\n\\tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also\\n\\tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor\\n\\twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the\\n\\tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.\\n\\n\\tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more\\n\\tthan 50 feet long.\\n\\nSubject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?\\n\\n\\tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746\\n\\twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,\\n\\tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200\\n\\twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,\\n\\tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational\\n\\tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.\\n\\n\\tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router\\n\\tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far\\n\\tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall\\n\\thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when\\n\\tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.\\n\\tWhat they don\\'t mention is that if you kept it in that\\n\\tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker\\n\\twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it\\'s drawing far\\n\\tmore current than it can continuously.\\n\\n\\tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This\\n\\tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can\\'t find that figure,\\n\\tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.\\n\\nSubject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?\\n\\n\\tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead\\n\\tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety\\n\\tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither\\n\\tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.\\n\\n\\tThere are several different approaches to solving this:\\n\\t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the\\n\\t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect\\n\\t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle\\n\\t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.\\n\\t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and\\n\\t       it\\'s continuous to the main house ground point, you can\\n\\t       run a conductor to it from the third prong.\\n\\t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.\\n\\t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug\\n\\t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI\\n\\t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI\\n\\t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong\\n\\t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,\\n\\t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it\\n\\t       wouldn\\'t be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault\\n\\t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected\\n\\t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren\\'t\\n\\t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath\\n\\t       on BX cable.\\n\\n\\tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three\\n\\tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.\\n\\tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.\\n\\nSubject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?\\n\\tShould the test button work?\\n\\n\\tWe\\'re sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,\\n\\tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there\\'s\\n\\ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE\\n\\tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current\\n\\tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.\\n\\tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn\\'t require\\n\\ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press\\n\\tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:\\n\\tif the test button doesn\\'t work, something\\'s broken, and potentially\\n\\tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.\\n\\n\\tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground\\n\\twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The\\n\\tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the\\n\\tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never\\n\\ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,\\n\\tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device\\n\\tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded\\n\\toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are\\n\\tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician\\n\\twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require\\n\\tit, and promised to investigate.)\\n\\nSubject: How should I wire my shop?\\n\\n\\tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all\\n\\tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies\\n\\tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the\\n\\tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for\\n\\tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or\\n\\tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have\\n\\tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp\\n\\tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles\\n\\twhich means you\\'d have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights\\n\\tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared\\n\\twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two\\n\\tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a\\n\\tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand\\n\\tRPM, while you\\'re groping in the dark for the OFF switch.\\n\\n\\tDo install lots of outlets.  It\\'s easier to install them in the\\n\\tbeginning, when you don\\'t have to cut into an existing cable.\\n\\tIt\\'s useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each\\n\\tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same\\n\\ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and\\n\\tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have\\n\\tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit\\n\\twrong.\\n\\n\\tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\"\\n\\trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used\\n\\tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be\\n\\trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.\\n\\n\\tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V\\n\\tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.\\n\\tDon\\'t overload circuits, and don\\'t use extension cords if you\\n\\tcan help it, unless they\\'re rated for high currents.  (A coiled\\n\\textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of\\n\\tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won\\'t withstand as much\\n\\theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)\\n\\n\\tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,\\n\\tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop\\n\\twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to\\n\\tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.\\n\\tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe\\'\\'\\n\\tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.\\n\\tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to\\n\\thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy\\n\\t``horsepower-rated\\'\\' switches instead.\\n\\n\\tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished\\n\\tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And\\n\\teven if you ``know\\'\\' that you\\'d never use one of your shop\\n\\toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might\\n\\thave a different idea.\\n\\n\\tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop\\n\\twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.\\n\\nSubject: Underground Wiring\\n\\n\\tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use\\n\\tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic\\n\\ttubing and possibly lumber (don\\'t use creosoted lumber, it rots\\n\\tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion\\n\\tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is\\n\\tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically\\n\\tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,\\n\\tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion\\n\\tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And\\n\\tof course, don\\'t forget the GFCIs.\\n\\n\\tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to\\n\\tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about\\n\\tyour specific situation.\\n\\n\\tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power\\n\\tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.\\n\\nSubject: Aluminum wiring\\n\\n\\tDuring the 1970\\'s, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became\\n\\tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,\\n\\taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,\\n\\tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.\\n\\tWe recommend, even if you\\'re allowed to, that do not use it for new\\n\\twiring.\\n\\n\\tBut don\\'t panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum\\n\\twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.\\n\\tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper\\n\\tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential\\n\\tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.\\n\\n\\tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as\\n\\t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When\\n\\tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes\\n\\tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each\\n\\ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes\\n\\twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance\\n\\tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/\\n\\toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,\\n\\tmelt the insulation or fixture it\\'s attached to, and possibly even\\n\\tcause a fire.\\n\\n\\tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move\\n\\tinto a house built during the 70\\'s, we will cover basic points of\\n\\tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you\\'re considering purchasing\\n\\ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you\\n\\thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\\n\\tfor the following things:\\n\\n\\t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\\n\\t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\\n\\t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes\\n\\t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat\\n\\t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.\\n\\n\\t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\\n\\t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\\n\\t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\\n\\t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug\\n\\t       up each connection.\\n\\n\\t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the\\n\\t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.\\n\\n\\t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.\\n\\t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with\\n\\t       the proper screw connections immediately.\\n\\n\\t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,\\n\\t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should\\n\\t       be repaired.\\n\\t    \\n\\t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be\\n\\t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the\\n\\t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting\\n\\t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be\\n\\t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an\\n\\t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter\\n\\t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless\\n\\t       you can rent the tool.\\n\\n\\t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring\\n\\t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above.\\n\\t    \\n\\t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped\\n\\t       (not nicked) wire etc.\\n    \\n\\tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring\\n\\tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider\\n\\tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,\\n\\twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,\\n\\tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having\\n\\tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.\\n\\tYou can do this yourself too.\\n\\nSubject: I\\'m buying a house!  What should I do?\\n\\n\\tCongratulations.  But...  It\\'s generally a good idea to hire\\n\\tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.\\n\\tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an\\n\\tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor\\n\\tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any\\n\\tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many\\n\\tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.\\n\\n\\tHere\\'s some hints on what to look for:\\n\\n\\tObvious non-code wiring can include:\\n\\n\\t\\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls\\n\\t\\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without\\n\\t\\t  proper marking.\\n\\t\\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of\\n\\t\\t  a GFCI)\\n\\t\\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)\\n\\t\\t- Switched neutrals\\n\\t\\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines\\n\\n\\tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one\\n\\ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:\\n\\n\\t\\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps\\n\\t\\t   not properly terminated wiring)\\n\\t\\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are\\n\\t\\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when\\n\\t\\t  it\\'s *really* convenient ;-)\\n\\t\\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations\\n\\t\\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps\\n\\t\\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them\\n\\t\\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or\\n\\t\\t  ceiling\\n\\t\\t- Backwrapped grounding wires\\n\\nSubject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring\\n\\t\\n\\tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different\\n\\twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you\\n\\tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old \\n\\tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.\\n\\n\\tThe oldest wiring system you\\'re likely to encounter is called\\n\\t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with\\n\\ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural\\n\\tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).\\n\\tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections\\n\\twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping\\n\\twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,\\n\\tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs\\n\\tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture.\\n\\tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some\\n\\tcases K&T isn\\'t colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same\\n\\tcolour as the hot wires.\\n\\n\\tYou\\'ll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40\\'s.\\n\\n\\tComments on K&T:\\n\\n\\t\\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about\\n\\t\\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.\\n\\t\\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up\\n\\t\\t  very well.  Most K&T I\\'ve seen, for example, is in\\n\\t\\t  quite good condition.\\n\\t\\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.\\n\\t\\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with\\n\\t\\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,\\n\\t\\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.\\n\\t\\t- Sometimes the neutral isn\\'t balanced very well between\\n\\t\\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to\\n\\t\\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on\\n\\t\\t  any circuit.\\n\\t\\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls\\n\\t\\t  that contain K&T.\\n\\t\\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be\\n\\t\\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector.\\n\\t\\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more\\n\\t\\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.\\n\\t\\n\\tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn\\'t\\n\\tnecessary to replace it simply because it\\'s K&T.  What you should\\n\\twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and\\n\\tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it\\'s perfectly\\n\\treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on\\n\\tnew circuits using modern techniques.\\n\\t\\n\\tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type\\n\\tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks\\n\\tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was\\n\\tused in the 40\\'s and 50\\'s.  Again, no grounding conductor.\\n\\tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback\\n\\tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We\\'ve seen whole\\n\\tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at\\n\\ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.\\n\\n\\tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if\\n\\tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as\\n\\tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.\\n\\tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several\\n\\thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink\\n\\ttubing.\\n\\n\\tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.\\n\\tIt\\'s almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.\\n\\tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn\\'t present a hazard\\n\\tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be\\n\\treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff -\\n\\tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don\\'t abuse it too much.\\n\\nSubject: Where do I buy stuff?\\n\\n\\tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their\\n\\tprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or\\n\\tDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety\\n\\tincluding the \"odd\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that\\n\\tknow what you\\'re talking about.

There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master \\n          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, \\n          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and \\n          after the life of Jesus. \\n    \\n               The followers of some of these Masters founded the \\n          world\\'s major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of \\n          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added \\n          THREATS of \"ETERNAL DAMNATION\" in Hell, and DELETED the \\n          teaching of REincarnation. \\n       \\n               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular \\n          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is \\n          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively \\n          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY \\n          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE \\n          UNIVERSES.)                             \\n\\n               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and \\n          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from \\n          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed \\n          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly \\n          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. \\n      \\n               And emotional \"feelings\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING \\n          indicator for religious validity. \\n    \\n               These things are similarly true for followers of most \\n          other major world religions, including Islam. \\n     \\n               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune \\n          His Initiates into the \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" or \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\", (referred to as \"THE WORD\" in John 1:1-5, and as \\n          \"The River of Life\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally \\n          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they \\n          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \\n          \"silver cord\". \\n    \\n               True Salvation, which completes a Soul\\'s cycles of \\n          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved \\n          only by reaching at least the \"SOUL PLANE\", which is five \\n          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this \\n          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri \\n          Harold Klemp, the Living \"Eck\" Master or \"Mahanta\" for the \\n          \"Eckankar\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, \\n          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). \\n    \\n               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now \\n          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \"Sant \\n          Mat\" organization. \\n      \\n               One of the classic books on this subject is \"THE PATH OF \\n          THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  \\n          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian \\n          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India \\n          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of \\n          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. \\n    \\n               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored \\n          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in \\n          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or \\n          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \"ECKANKAR--THE \\n          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER \\n          classic. \\n    \\n               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with \\n          the \"Anti-Christ\", which is or was to be a temporary world \\n          dictator during the so-called \"last days\".  But the Masters \\n          don\\'t ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as \\n          Jesus was. \\n    \\n               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or \\n          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will \\n          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the \\n          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they \\n          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n          \\n    \\n          RE-INCARNATION\\n          \\n               The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, \\n          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation \\n          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past \\n          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes \\n          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], \\n          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of \\n          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, \\n          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-\\n          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-\\n          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-\\n          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS \\n          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the \\n          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How \\n          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED \\n          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \"KING JAMES VERSION\".  Later \\n          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] \\n          \\n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \\n          typically originate from a person\\'s PAST LIVES.  For example, \\n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \\n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \\n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \\n          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, \\n          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \\n          INCARNATION. \\n\\n               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF \\n          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would \\n          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their \\n          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the \\n          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \\n\\n\\n\\n          \"2nd COMINGS\"\\n\\n               If a Divine Master physically dies (\"translates\") \\n          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that \\n          Initiate physically dies (\"translates\"), the Master will meet \\n          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul \\n          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd \\n          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that \\n          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still \\n          waiting for Jesus\\' \"2nd Coming\" are WAITING IN VAIN. \\n    \\n          \\n          \\n          PLANES OF EXISTENCE\\n\\n               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN \\n          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the \\n          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric \\n          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), \\n          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The \\n          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from \\n          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the \\n          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. \\n    \\n               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological \\n          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See \\n          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without \\n          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between \\n          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. \\n    \\n               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.

As the punctilious scholars have written\\nmany volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood,\\nhere we will briefly point out only the general category\\ninto which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted\\nas accurate reports.\\n    The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad\\n(SAW) fall into two main categories:  \\n\\n    The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal \\nevents that happened at the time of his birth, or before his \\ndeclaration of prophethood.  \\n\\n    The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences \\nof the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions: \\n\\n    1) Those wonders that were manifested after\\nhis departure from this world in order to confirm his\\nprophethood, and \\n\\t2) Those that he exhibited during the era\\nof his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:  \\n\\t2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest\\nin his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral\\nconduct and perfection, and \\n    2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.  \\nThe last part again has two branches:  \\n\\t2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and \\n\\t2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last \\nbranch is again divided into two categories:  \\n\\t2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings \\nthat occured during his mission either to break the \\nstubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the\\nfaith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different\\nsorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of\\nwater from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with\\na little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals\\nEach of these sons has also many instances, and thus\\nhas, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by\\nconsensus.  \\n\\t2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this\\nincludes events lying in the future that occured as he had\\npredicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.

Very obsolete; use 74F.\\n\\n74L\\tModification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.\\n\\tVery obsolete; use CMOS.\\n\\n74S\\tLater modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in\\n\\tpower consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.\\n\\n74LS\\tCombination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower\\n\\tpower consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of\\n\\tdevices.\\n\\n74F\\tFast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high\\n\\tspeed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.\\n\\n74AS\\tFailed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things\\n\\tthat are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.\\n\\n74ALS\\tPossible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly\\n\\tnew, availability and prices possibly a problem.\\n\\n74C\\tFairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with\\n\\t4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer\\n\\tCMOS 74 families.\\n\\n4000\\t(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS\\n\\tfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low\\n\\tpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.\\n\\tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\\n\\tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\\n\\tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The\\n\\tclear choice when speed is not important.\\n\\n74HC\\tA new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power\\n\\tconsumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for\\n\\tgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.\\n\\tCMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of\\n\\tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\\n\\tconsumption at faster speeds.\\n\\n74HCT\\t74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read\\n\\tthe fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility\\n\\tin CMOS involves some compromises.\\n\\n10K\\t(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources\\n\\tclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for\\n\\tserious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow\\n\\tthe rules or it won\\'t work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,\\n\\tcan be expensive.\\n\\n100K\\t(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and\\n\\tinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.\\n\\nAs for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and\\n74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices\\nyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just\\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\\n\\nMe?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are\\ninteresting but I haven\\'t used either significantly yet.\\n-- \\nAll work is one man\\'s work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\\n                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\\n', 'From: schroedj@cnsvax.uwec.edu\\nSubject: ForSale 286 and Hard-drive\\nOrganization: University of Wisconsin Eau Claire\\nLines: 17\\n\\nPacker Bell 12MHZ 286\\n  * 5 16bit expansion slots\\n  * 2 5.25\" external drive bays (floppies)\\n  * 1 3.5\" internal drive bay (hard-drive)\\n  * 1.44MB 3.5\" floppy drive\\n  * 1MB of RAM\\n \\n$140 or Best offer (including shipping)\\n \\nSegate 32MB ST138N SCSI Hard-drive\\n  * Great shape\\n  * Controller\\n  * 32MB\\n  * 3.5\" format\\n \\n$85 or best offer (including shipping)\\n \\n', 'From: khiet@crystallizer.ecn.purdue.edu (Peter Thanh Khiet Vu)\\nSubject: Wanted: AIRCONDITIONER\\nKeywords: WANTED\\nOrganization: Purdue University Engineering Computer Network\\nLines: 4\\n\\n   I am looking for a good used window air conditioner.

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \\nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \\nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \\nthe histories I\\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \\nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\\nis possible that the histories I\\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\\nit - would it be in Hitler\\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \\n\\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \\nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \\nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \\nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \\nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \\n1920\\'s.\\n\\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\\n>tainted evidence. \\n\\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \\nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\\'ve read), I\\'d like to know \\nwhat tainted \"evidence\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \\nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \\naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \\n1920\\'s and 30\\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \\ntime and plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \\nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \\nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \\nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \\nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \\nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \\nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \\nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\\n\\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, \"Storm Troopers\" -- left the world a better\\n>place when they departed, \\n\\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \\n\\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \\nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \\nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\\'t you write them \\nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\\'t tell from \\ntheir footnotes? I\\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\\ntracking down sources is old hat.

I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and\\nI suppose that it might be useful here.  Note that I do not necessarily\\nagree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information.\\n\\n *\\n\\nFor a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book\\nclaiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity.\\n(Mr Holly\\'s father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on the\\nMasons.)\\n\\nThe SBC\\'s Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department,\\nwhich studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A few\\nyears ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded\\nthat it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality.\\nHowever, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and\\nlast year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the\\nfeeling that they were saying \"You got the wrong answer last time, try to\\ndo better and get the answer we want.\")\\n\\nAnyway, there\\'s been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but\\nthe dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it,\\nbut everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things\\nsuch as: \"This was the best we were going to get in the current environment.\"\\n\\nThe report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the\\nhospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the\\nelderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well-\\nknown Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings\\nof Masonry are \"supportive of Christian faith and practice\".  Examples of\\nthe latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and\\nthat some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.\\n\\nOn the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible\\nwith Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some\\npeople consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they\\nare not meant seriously), the \"undeniably pagan and/or occultic\" writings of\\nsome Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation\\ncan be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many\\nMasonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole\\naren\\'t really in a place to speak on this last point.)\\n\\n\\nThe report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership\\nshould not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals.\\nThis was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges,\\nand while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may\\nnot.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of\\nthe believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably\\ninfluenced how the report came out.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThe information above was gleaned from \"The Religious Herald\", a publication\\nof the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and \"Baptists Today\", which\\ndoes not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is a\\nbig issue among some Baptists.  8-)\\n\\nBecause I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents are\\nrelevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.

Mr. England wrote the \\nfollowing as part of a book review section in This People\\'s magazine (Spring \\n1993 edition):\\n\\n  \"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--\\n  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other \\n  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian \\n  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around\\n  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude\\n  those who don\\'t fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central\\n  defining characteristic of a good American might be \"one who doesn\\'t draw\\n  exclusive circles\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the \\n  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to\\n  draw a circle around \"Mormon\" or \"Christian,\" to decide who is \"orthodox\"\\n  and who isn\\'t by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider\\n  that the central pillar of Christ\\'s \"orthodoxy\" is our ability to love\\n  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.\\n\\n  \"I recently spent some time in a \"Christian\" bookstore in California. The\\n  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and\\n  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural\\n  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.\\n  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking \\n  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American\\n  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \"Cults and the\\n  Occult,\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same\\n  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found\\n  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers\\n  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous\\n  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations\\n  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).\\n\\n  \"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to\\n  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\"Perfect\\n  love casteth out fear,\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the\\n  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a \\n  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the\\n  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive\\n  action---as the \"religious right wing\" has launched this year against the\\n  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don\\'t like.\\n  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the\\n  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,\\n  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons\\' rights along with those of\\n  others they believe to be evil.\"\\n\\n\\nThe above \"sermon\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe\\nto This People\\'s magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who\\nrely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His\\narms.  \\n\\nEven though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles \\nof the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim \\nperfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do \\nnow lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \"Christian\", if \\nthose who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are \\nintollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical \\nscriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication \\nthan mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the \\nmajority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective \\nvoice is louder.

My Conscience fits in more with\\nFreud\\'s SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the\\nurges or Freud\\'s Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud\\'s Ego,\\nI suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why\\nConscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \"what\\nprovides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\".

Though,\\ngiven my principle that one CANNOT force one\\'s own notion of \"sin\" on\\nanother, and my unshakeable \"disestablishmentarianism\", Russel Turpin\\nand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my\\nlegislating my own understanding of Christian love.\\n\\n>If I take him at\\n>his word, he cannot condemn the Inquisitors, because they were\\n>also following these commandments as *they* understood them.  If\\n\\nYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\\n\\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\\nprohibitions.\\n\\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\\n\\n\\tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\\n\\t    in the Inquisition.\\n\\n\\tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\\n\\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\\n\\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\\n\\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\\n\\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\\n\\n\\tA.  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\\n\\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\\n\\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\\n\\n\\tB.  Burns me at the stake.\\n\\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\\n\\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor\\'s B,\\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\\nof charges brought against them.)\\n\\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.  The \"conservative\" (I don\\'t think that\\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\\nthe gospel, as if one\\'s theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\\nJesus\\' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\\n\\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\\n\\n>(Or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one\\'s fellow\\n>man?) And what is the \"right thing\"?  And how does one go about\\n>loving god? \\n\\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\\nthey *aren\\'t* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one\\'s actions.  The Great\\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don\\'t keep YOUR rules.\"\\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \"conservatives\" have\\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\\n\\n>Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo\\n>up front, much of which sounds pretty much the same, but by the\\n>*specific* acts, procedures, and arguments that they recommend.\\n\\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\\nIt does not have a QU\\'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\\n\\n\\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\\n\\t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\\n\\t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I\\'ll\\n\\t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\\n\\t there is a huge amount of \"cultural baggage\" involved.]\\n\\nYou are quite right that this is \"goo\" if one is looking for an ethical\\nsystem.\\n\\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\\nmay be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\\n-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\\n\\n>I am glad that a few Christians,\\n>such as Michael, find a benign meaning for the goo, and then\\n>interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive\\n>fashion.

Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nA couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \\nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A\\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\\nreferences though, \"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New\\nTestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\\nfurther context).  \\n\\nThe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in\\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one\\'s life by hanging.\" He then\\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\\nhanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by\\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\\ndenoted as the result). \\n\\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\\n\\n> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\\n> it\\'s only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice \\n> was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house,\\n> to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and \\n> died; and he was buried in his father\\'s tomb.\"   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n> ^^^^ \\n> Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept.,\\n> APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\\n> result.\\n> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\\n\\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\\nHebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \\nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \\n\\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\\nhistorical source to justify it. \\n\\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose\\'s statement about trees around the Potter\\'s Field:\\n\\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\n\\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \\n\\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\\nas the 30 silvers:\\n\\n> As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\\n> money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\\n> than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\\n> mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\\n> what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\\n> Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\\n> that when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\\n> discusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\\n> it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\\n> \\n>  \\n> Notice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\\n> that Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\\n> But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\\n> obtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\\n>          ^^^^^^\\n\\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas\\' betrayal\\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas\\'\\nactions \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\\nthe money box, but rather said:\\n\\n    \"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\\n     him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\\n     it was night.\"\\n\\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \\n\\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas\\' hanging was\\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\\nthat night as well, and thus couldn\\'t have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \\n\\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\\n\\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter\\'s field came from (ie: the\\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\\n\\n> Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\\n> this with you.\\n\\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now.

We also believe that being \"offspring\" of\\nGod has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually \"born again\" of\\nHim.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.

You did not refer to the Mormon belief\\nthat Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie\\'s belief in same.

In sum, Ezekiel prophesied\\nthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of\\npeople living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used\\ndifferently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes\\nhappens that someone says \"My grandson is the cutest baby!\" and then turns\\naround and sees the granddaughter and says \"Oh!  Isn\\'t she the cutest thing!?\"\\n\\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\\nfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very\\nobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,\\nnobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is\\noften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly\\nliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,\\nit is not.\\n\\n\\nTurning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from\\nJohn E King:\\n\\n> The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the\\n> area[.]\\n\\nNo, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from\\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say\\n\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff\\nlike that.\"  You would read \"I will make you a bare rock\" and \"You will never\\nbe rebuilt\", and you\\'d conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way\\nto get from `fishing nets\\' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\\npopulation\\' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\\n\\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\\n\\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" means \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\\nit is hardly a `clear implication\\'.\\n\\n\\nMr King also writes:\\n\\n> So far I\\'ve seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.\\n> Let\\'s assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards\\n> we are talking about a one-horse town.\\n\\nWell, no.  That\\'s only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I\\'m\\nfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\\nresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but\\nit\\'s at least a two-horse town.\\n\\nBut supposing 22,000 people is a \"small town\" -- it\\'s still 22,000 people\\nMORE than Ezekiel predicted.\\n\\n\\nAnd you\\'ve said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\\npredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\\nvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying \"he and his army got no reward from the\\ncampaign he led against Tyre.\"\\n\\nLet\\'s ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says\\nthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.\\n\\nRegardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before\\nthe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\\n\\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\\nby pulling some \"clear implications\" out of hat.\\n\\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearly implied\\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine houses\\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\", that clearly implied\\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\\nwould \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearly implies that N. would\\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\\nwalls.\\n\\nSee?  A few \"clear implications\" that are totally contrary to the text, and\\nyou can reconcile anything you want.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\"[Do] You know why I\\'m the enabler?

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in\\nany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference\\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\\n(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\\n\\nFor power:\\n\\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\\n\\nFor amplitude\\n\\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\\n\\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\\nconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.\\n\\nCommon references for audio are:\\n\\n\\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\\n\\t0 dBV = 1 volt\\n\\n\\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\\n\\t0 VU = -10dBV\\t(consumer gear line level)\\n\\n\\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\\nor moment.\\n\\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\\npower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done\\nwith the above two identities and ohm's law.\\n\\n-- \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n       Dave Medin\\t\\t\\tPhone:\\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\\n    SSD--Networking\\t\\t\\t\\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\\n    Intergraph Corp.\\n       M/S GD3004 \\t\\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\\t\\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\\n\\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\\n\\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\\n\", 'From: zoron@en.ecn.purdue.edu (Soren M Burkhart)\\nSubject: Dragon\\'s Lair II & Space Ace ARCADE games for sale\\nKeywords: laser games interactive\\nOrganization: Purdue University Engineering Computer Network\\nLines: 64\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n   Dragon\\'s Lair II ($400 Complete)\\n-------------------------------------\\n \\n \\n  or \\n \\n   $220 Laser Disc\\n   $150 Motherboard/Joystick/buttons\\n   $35  Graphics (For arcade cabinet)\\n   $50  Brick Power Supply +12/-12/+5\\n \\n  Space Ace ($430 Complete)\\n--------------------------------------\\n \\n  or \\n \\n   $250 Laser Disc\\n   $150 Motherboard/Joystick/buttons\\n   $35  Graphics (For arcade cabinet)\\n   $50  Brick Power Supply +12/-12/+5\\n    \\n \\n   Both Space Ace and Dragon\\'s Lair II ($750)\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n \\n   These games require a Sony 1450 Laserdisc player.

The purpose of the conference was to\\npublish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed\\nto prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it\\nbacked away from the \"Family Values\" positons of the \\'92 convention.\\n\\nConservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson\\'s organization\\nwith political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications\\nsupport.\\n\\nThe Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version\\nof the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes.\\nMs. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom\\nCouncil in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.\\n\\nMs. Elwell was hired by Domino\\'s Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989\\nto manage Legatus, a \"nonpolitical\", Catholic businessmen\\'s group.\\nMembership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4\\nmillion in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts\\nat Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the\\nCatholic Campaign.\\n\\nThe Campaign\\'s list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep.\\nRobert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely\\nPat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national\\ncommittee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson\\'s\\nAmerican Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas\\nPatrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson\\'s ACLJ, is also an\\nactive supporter of the Catholic Campaign.\\n\\nThe board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec\\nand former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank\\nLynch, former Reagan official Richard V.

Science has its basis in observable fact. \\n\\nI\\'d say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is\\ninterpreted and what significance it\\'s given depends a great deal on\\nthe values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such,\\nis subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human\\nactivity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or\\nethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure\\nfrom nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.\\n\\nBill\\n\\n: If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\\n: first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\\n: the meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\\n\\n: So, back to the original question:\\n\\n: And objective morality is.....?\\n\\nThis may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.\\nObjective in the sense used here means something immutable and\\nabsolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of\\npeople. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The\\nconcept supposedly described may have meaning however. \\nIf there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then\\nHe has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His\\nexistence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this\\nbeing declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has\\ndefined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,\\nHe is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically\\nself-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an\\nobjective sense.\\nIf God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.\\nIf human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that\\nstandard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative\\nmorality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,\\nmeaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to\\nmisunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to\\nmeet that standard is therefore objectively determined.\\nJust because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is\\ninfinitely malleable, doesn\\'t mean that the objective standard itself\\ndoesn\\'t exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural\\nnorm, or the preferred conduct of \"decent\" people, making it seem\\nsubjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.\\nIronically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true\\nnature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being\\ncontrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as\\n\\nBill\\nmuch to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it\\nor not, it\\'s there.x\\n', 'From: JACK.T.SENDAK@OFFICE.WANG.COM (\"Jack T.

To assist cooling\\nand the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the\\nhot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than\\njust air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is\\nrapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently\\nseen rising out of these towers.\\n\\nThat slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because\\nit produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of\\nthe air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.\\n\\nThe towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam\\nsystem of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the\\nboiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across\\nthe turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and\\nby recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it\\nback to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference\\n(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \"hot\"\\nturbine to final stage \"cold\" turbine).\\n\\n                                        R.

Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n'}\n"
